d5f8f2e2-de9a-4235-a399-c18f1d55799e	Sophie Anderson	sophie-anderson	31	Female	she/her	Elementary school teacher	Single (first time in 13 years)	Sophie (31, elementary teacher) has never been single for more than 3 weeks since age 18. She just ended a 5-year relationship with Chris (who wouldn't commit to marriage) and has been single for 4 months—a record. She realizes she loses herself completely in every relationship: adopts partner's interests, ignores red flags, stays too long, and has no idea what she actually wants separate from partners. Friends say "you become a different person with each boyfriend." Now a guy from work is flirting and she's tempted to jump in, but part of her knows she needs to stay single longer. She ran into Chris with his new girlfriend (he moved on in 3 weeks), had a panic attack at home, and couldn't name what SHE likes independent of ex's preferences. Downloaded dating apps "just to look" (dangerous territory).\n\nKey Coaching Challenges: Learning to be alone for first time, developing identity outside of relationships, resisting urge to jump into next relationship, managing anxiety that spikes when single, breaking serial monogamy pattern, dealing with timeline pressure (approaching 31, wants marriage/kids).\n\nWhat Sophie Wants: To feel okay being alone, to figure out who she actually is, to break pattern of serial monogamy, to not jump into next relationship out of fear, to choose next partner wisely when actually ready, to stop feeling incomplete without boyfriend.\n\nClient Presentation Style: Self-aware and articulate, self-deprecating humor about pattern, talks fast when anxious, spirals into "what ifs," rationalizes why dating work guy would be "different," seeks constant reassurance, defensive about wanting to date again.	2	Easy-Medium	{#serial-monogamy,#identity-crisis,#codependency,#fear-of-being-alone,#relationship-patterns,#boundaries,#self-discovery,#dating-anxiety,#impulsivity,#timeline-pressure}	{"Serial monogamy pattern","Identity development","Fear of being alone",Codependency}	{"Romantic and idealistic about love","Adaptable (sometimes to point of losing herself)","Nurturing and caring, natural relationship builder","Anxious when alone, calmer when partnered","Optimistic but increasingly disillusioned","Self-aware enough to know pattern but not how to break it"}	Lonely and anxious about being single, proud of herself for staying single (been 4 months) but terrified, tempted to jump into next relationship, questioning if she even knows who she is, excited about possibility of doing this differently, scared she's "wasted" her 20s on wrong relationships	{"pattern": {"never_single_since": "Age 18", "pattern_description": "Always has next relationship lined up before leaving current one", "total_relationships": "4 major relationships spanning 13 years", "longest_single_period": "3 weeks between Mike and Chris"}, "current_temptation": {"awareness": "Part of her knows needs to be single longer", "dating_apps": "Downloaded 'just to look' - dangerous territory", "guy_from_work": "Has been flirting for weeks", "friend_opinions": "Split - some say 'get back out there,' others say 'please don't'", "sophie_interest": "Part of her wants to pursue it"}, "past_relationships": [{"ages": "18-20", "duration": "2 years", "partner_name": "High school boyfriend"}, {"ages": "20-24", "context": "College boyfriend", "duration": "4 years", "partner_name": "Dan"}, {"ages": "24-26", "context": "Post-college", "duration": "2 years", "partner_name": "Mike"}, {"ages": "26-31", "context": "Most recent, just ended", "duration": "5 years", "partner_name": "Chris"}], "pattern_recognition": {"loses_self": "Adopts partner's interests, friends, lifestyle every time", "stays_too_long": "Doesn't know what she wants vs what partners want", "friend_feedback": "Friends say 'you become different person with each boyfriend'", "ignores_red_flags": "Being alone feels worse than wrong relationship"}, "most_recent_relationship": {"duration": "5 years", "partner_name": "Chris", "who_ended_it": "Sophie finally ended it when realized he'd never propose", "breakup_reason": "Sophie wanted marriage, Chris wanted to 'wait and see'", "living_together": "Yes, moved in after 8 months", "friend_group_impact": "Entire friend group was 'couple friends' - now feels isolated", "chris_current_status": "Already dating someone new (after 3 weeks)"}}	{"core_conflicts": ["Identity completely wrapped up in being someone's girlfriend", "Deep fear of being alone (feels like something wrong with her)", "Doesn't know own interests, values, preferences separate from partners", "Equates being single with being unlovable", "Recognizes pattern but terrified to break it", "Approaching 31, feeling pressure about timeline (marriage, kids)", "Anxiety spikes when single, calms when partnered (unhealthy coping)"], "contributing_factors": ["Used relationships as identity since age 18", "Never developed independent sense of self", "Confuses being loved with being complete", "Picks partners based on 'anything better than alone'", "Molds herself to each partner to keep them", "Societal/family pressure about marriage timeline", "Watched Chris move on in 3 weeks - feels rejection"]}	Ran into Chris and his new girlfriend at coffee shop.

Her 10-year "best friendship" with Taylor is completely one-sided—Taylor only calls with problems, never asks about Jasmine, has borrowed $500 for 6 months without repaying, and recently said "I can't deal with this right now" when Jasmine mentioned her own problem. At work, Jasmine takes on everyone's tasks, stays late constantly, and is underpaid. In dating, she attracts emotionally unavailable people and does all the emotional heavy lifting. Her family expects her to drop everything for "emergencies" that aren't emergencies. The final straw: Taylor called at 11pm for a 2-hour crisis, then dismissed Jasmine's needs the next day. Jasmine is exhausted, resentful, and doesn't know how to say no without feeling like a terrible person.\n\nKey Coaching Challenges: Learning to set boundaries without guilt, distinguishing kindness from doormat behavior, addressing one-sided friendship, breaking pattern of attracting takers, managing family expectations, building self-worth outside of helping others.\n\nWhat Jasmine Wants: To have reciprocal relationships, to say no without panic and guilt, to feel less exhausted and resentful, to date someone emotionally available, to address the Taylor situation without losing her, to understand boundaries don't make her selfish.\n\nClient Presentation Style: Articulate and empathetic, apologizes constantly, over-explains and justifies, makes excuses for others' behavior, "I don't want to sound selfish, but..." qualifies everything, minimizes own hurt.	3	Medium	{#boundaries,#people-pleasing,#one-sided-friendships,#emotional-labor,#burnout,#dating-patterns,#conflict-avoidance,#codependency,#work-life-balance,#self-worth}	{Boundary-setting,People-pleasing,"One-sided relationships","Emotional exhaustion"}	{"Deeply empathetic, often to own detriment","Natural caretaker who struggles to receive care","Bubbly and energetic externally, exhausted internally","Conflict-avoidant people-pleaser","Idealistic about relationships and friendships","Passionate about social justice, applies it to everyone but herself"}	Burned out from emotional labor for everyone in life, resentful but guilty about feeling resentful, exhausted and running on fumes, starting to realize she has no real boundaries, frustrated that keeps attracting "takers", hopeful things can change but skeptical she can actually do it	{"work_dynamic": {"pattern": "Takes on everyone else's work because she 'doesn't mind'", "schedule": "Stays late constantly, comes in on weekends", "time_off": "Hasn't had real vacation in 2 years", "compensation": "Underpaid compared to colleagues with same role", "boss_behavior": "Relies on her to fix everything", "colleague_behavior": "Dump their tasks on her"}, "dating_pattern": {"dynamic": "Always the one doing emotional heavy lifting", "pattern": "Keeps dating emotionally unavailable people", "most_recent": "Guy she was seeing for 2 months ghosted after she opened up", "friend_feedback": "Friends tell her she's 'too much' or 'too intense'", "jasmine_question": "Wonders if something is wrong with her", "typical_trajectory": "Gets excited about someone, they lose interest"}, "family_pattern": {"mom": "Calls multiple times a day with problems", "sister": "'Borrows' things and never returns them", "siblings": "Take advantage of her generosity", "birth_order": "Youngest of three, always the 'helper'", "expectations": "Expected to drop everything for family emergencies (often not emergencies)", "parental_view": "Don't see imbalance, think Jasmine is 'just nice'"}, "best_friend_taylor": {"name": "Taylor", "duration": "10 years, since college", "final_straw": "Taylor called 11pm for 2-hour crisis.

His wife Rachel gave him an ultimatum last week: "Something has to change." He missed his son Ethan's championship soccer game after promising to be there—Ethan's response: "It's okay Dad, I didn't think you'd come anyway." That line devastated him. His kids (9 and 6) have stopped expecting him at events, there's no intimacy with Rachel, and he hasn't taken a real day off in years. David equates providing financially with showing love, uses work to avoid emotional discomfort, and is becoming the workaholic father he resented as a child. He's defensive about work-life balance criticism but terrified he's running out of time to fix this.\n\nKey Coaching Challenges: Learning to be emotionally present vs. just physically present, delegating without feeling like failure, setting work boundaries that won't tank business, rebuilding relationships with emotionally distant kids, communicating feelings (terrible at it), breaking generational workaholic pattern.\n\nWhat David Wants: To save marriage before it's too late, to have real relationships with kids, to feel less stressed and "on," to prove he can be successful AND a good father/husband, to stop feeling guilty when with family.\n\nClient Presentation Style: Direct and efficient, solution-oriented, uses business language and frameworks, logical sequential thinking, lists everything he's providing when defensive, struggles to articulate feelings, treats relationship like business problem.	4	Medium-Hard	{#workaholism,#work-life-balance,#marriage-crisis,#emotional-unavailability,#absent-father,#startup-founder,#generational-patterns,#presence,#intimacy-issues,#ultimatum}	{Workaholism,"Work-life balance","Emotional presence","Marriage crisis"}	{"Driven and ambitious, sometimes to a fault","Type-A personality, difficulty relaxing","Logical problem-solver, uncomfortable with emotions","Perfectionist with impossibly high standards","Generous provider, equates love with financial security","Defensive when criticized, especially about work"}	Stressed and overwhelmed but "handling it", defensive about work-life balance criticism, guilty about missing family moments but justifies it, anxious about business success (constant pressure), disconnected from wife and kids but doesn't know how to reconnect, frustrated that "doing everything right" isn't working	{"the_kids": {"son_ethan": {"age": 9, "name": "Ethan", "impact": "This line devastated David more than expected", "current_state": "Stopped asking dad to come to games", "recent_comment": "'It's okay Dad, I didn't think you'd come anyway'"}, "daughter_mia": {"age": 6, "name": "Mia", "observation": "Says 'Daddy's always working'", "relationship": "Polite but distant with him"}, "david_absence": ["Misses most school events, bedtimes, family dinners", "Tries to compensate with expensive gifts", "Kids are polite but distant", "Doesn't know what's happening in their daily lives"]}, "the_business": {"age": "4 years in, finally successful", "funding": "Series B secured last year ($15M)", "behavior": "Checks email during family time, takes calls during dinner", "time_off": "Can't remember last real day off", "team_size": "35 employees depending on him", "work_hours": "70-80 hour weeks including weekends", "company_type": "Tech startup", "investor_pressure": "Constant pressure from investors"}, "family_of_origin": {"father": "Was workaholic and unpredictable", "mother": "Walked on eggshells around father", "pattern": "Repeating what he swore he'd never do", "david_childhood": "Resented absent father", "current_realization": "Realizes he's becoming his father"}, "marriage_to_rachel": {"ages": "Met in grad school, married at 26", "duration": "12 years", "intimacy": "Haven't been on date in 8 months, intimacy nearly non-existent", "ultimatum": "Last week: 'Something has to change'", "spouse_name": "Rachel", "current_state": "Now says he's 'married to his work'", "early_support": "She was supportive of startup initially", "conflict_frequency": "Frequent arguments about his absence", "rachel_perspective": "Feels like single parent, lonely in marriage"}}	{"core_conflicts": ["Unmanaged work addiction destroying family", "Equates providing financially with showing love", "Uses work to avoid emotional discomfort", "Becoming the absent father he resented as child", "Can't separate identity from work success", "Fears slowing down means everything will fall apart", "Doesn't know how to be emotionally present", "Growing resentment: doing this FOR them and they're mad?"], "contributing_factors": ["Startup culture glorifies overwork", "Investor pressure creates real stakes", "Never learned emotional presence from own father", "Work feels controllable, family feels chaotic", "Financial success is measurable, love is not", "Conflict avoidance through work immersion", "Fear of vulnerability and emotional expression"]}	Missed Ethan's championship soccer game after promising to be there.

Their 8-month relationship deteriorated due to declining sexual intimacy related to Jordan's pre-existing injury and exploration of his sexuality. During a heated argument while intoxicated, Alex slapped Jordan—an incident that contributed to the breakup and that Alex deeply regrets. The 19-year age gap created maturity and expectation mismatches. Jordan has kept the physical altercation private out of respect, and they occasionally see each other through mutual friends with minimal interaction. Alex has made behavioral changes (stopped excessive drinking) and wants to demonstrate real growth, rebuild trust, and either reconcile or achieve healthy closure.\n\nKey Coaching Challenges: Physical violence history, shame management, age-gap dynamics, communication about sexual needs, accountability without self-flagellation, realistic expectations about reconciliation.\n\nWhat Alex Wants: To reconcile with Jordan, demonstrate genuine change, create emotional safety for Jordan to be authentic, address the lasting impact of the slapping incident, and develop tools for vulnerable communication.\n\nClient Presentation Style: Emotionally invested and intense, intellectualizes feelings as defense mechanism, oscillates between hope and fear, articulate but can spiral into anxiety, genuinely remorseful but fears being defined by worst moment.	4	Medium-Hard	{#reconciliation,#past-violence,#age-gap,#lgbtq,#accountability,#shame,#physical-aggression,#sexual-intimacy-issues,#communication-breakdown,#recent-breakup}	{"Reconciliation after violence","Age-gap relationship dynamics","Sexual intimacy communication","Shame and accountability"}	{"Emotionally invested and passionate in relationships","Struggles with patience when feeling unheard or rejected","Self-aware enough to seek help but still processing shame","Can be intense and have high expectations of partners","Genuinely cares deeply but sometimes expresses it in controlling ways","Intellectualizes emotions as a defense mechanism","Takes responsibility for actions but fears being defined by worst moments"}	Carrying heavy shame about physical altercation with ex, experiencing anxiety and physical stress symptoms related to breakup, hopeful about reconciliation but uncertain how to proceed, frustrated by lack of clarity and closure, fearful that relationship's worst moment will be its lasting legacy, determined to make positive changes and demonstrate growth	{"mutual_context": {"shared_friends": true, "partner_discretion": "Jordan has kept physical altercation details private out of respect for Alex", "friend_group_impact": "Source of tension after breakup"}, "current_or_recent": {"partner_age": 26, "partner_name": "Jordan Matthews", "age_gap_impact": "19-year age difference created power imbalance and different life stages.

Currently dating Nathan (3 months, 8-9 dates), who's everything she usually wants, but he wants to introduce her to his friends and she's been avoiding plans for 2 weeks. He texted yesterday: "Are you okay? You've been distant"—she hasn't responded in 18 hours and feels the familiar urge to run. In college, her boyfriend Marcus cheated with her roommate after 3 years together when she was fully vulnerable; she swore she'd never give anyone that power again. Now she sabotages when things are going well, pulls away when someone gets close, and keeps relationships casual as long as possible. She's almost 30, hasn't had a real relationship since college (7 years ago), and realizes if she doesn't fix this, she'll end up alone.\n\nKey Coaching Challenges: Stopping automatic urge to run, deciding whether to respond to Nathan or let him go, getting past what Marcus did 7 years ago, tolerating vulnerability without panicking, understanding why friend introductions trigger panic, communicating needs without ghosting.\n\nWhat Zara Wants: To stop running when things get good, to feel safe being vulnerable, to have a real relationship for once, to not hurt people she cares about, to get past Marcus betrayal, to respond to Nathan and actually show up, to break the cycle.\n\nClient Presentation Style: Funny and self-deprecating, uses humor to talk about serious stuff, creative analogies, deflects with jokes when defensive ("I'm just not a relationship person"), drops humor when vulnerable, talks about running/escaping when panicking, already mentally checked out when listing partner's flaws.	4	Medium-Hard	{#avoidant-attachment,#ghosting,#commitment-phobia,#fear-of-vulnerability,#self-sabotage,#dating-patterns,#trust-issues,#past-trauma,#intimacy-avoidance,#running-away}	{"Avoidant attachment style","Chronic ghosting pattern","Commitment phobia","Past betrayal trauma"}	{"Free-spirited and independent (sometimes to a fault)","Charismatic and engaging initially, then disappears","Creative and spontaneous","Deeply uncomfortable with vulnerability","Self-aware about patterns but struggles to change","Uses humor to deflect from serious topics"}	Lonely but keeps people at arm's length, frustrated with herself for repeating pattern, scared of intimacy but wants connection, defensive when called out on ghosting, sad that keeps sabotaging good things, starting to wonder if capable of real relationship	{"ghosting_pattern": {"method": "Disappears completely, blocks numbers if needed", "trigger": "Usually happens right when things get serious", "aftermath": "Feels awful but does it anyway", "sometimes": "Reappears months later with excuse", "total_ghosted": "Approximately 15 people in last 5 years", "friend_reaction": "Friends are exhausted by pattern", "most_recent_before_nathan": "Ghosted Ryan after he said 'I love you'"}, "college_boyfriend_marcus": {"vow": "Swore she'd never give anyone that power again", "ages": "19-22 (college)", "name": "Marcus", "impact": "Devastated her, changed how she does relationships", "betrayal": "He cheated with her roommate", "discovery": "Found out via Instagram post", "time_since": "7 years ago but still affects her", "future_plans": "Planned future together", "relationship_quality": "Completely in love, fully vulnerable"}, "current_situation_nathan": {"name": "Nathan", "dates": "Been on 8-9 dates, getting more serious", "how_met": "Art gallery opening 3 months ago", "his_text": "'Are you okay?

Working 70-80 hour weeks under intense pressure, he comes home and yells when stressed—his twin sons (11) get quiet when he gets loud, one flinches when he raises his voice. He hasn't hit anyone but recently punched a wall during an argument. Last week he lost a major client, came home furious, and screamed at his son Jack for spilling juice on work papers. Jack cried, his brother ran to his room, and Cameron's wife Lauren said: "That's it. You get help or I'm taking the kids to my sister's." The next morning, Jack wouldn't come out of his room.

She left her office manager career 20 years ago "temporarily" when pregnant and never returned—her entire identity became "mom." Now her kids have their own lives (daughter 27 lives across country, barely takes her calls; son's fiancée is planning wedding without much input from Patty), her marriage to Tom is more roommate than partnership (watch TV in separate rooms, no intimacy in a year), and she has no career, no hobbies, and few friends. When her son announced his engagement, she cried—partly happy, partly devastated for herself. Her daughter recently said "Mom, you need to get a life," which stung because it's true. Patty has no idea who she is outside of motherhood and the house is too quiet, too clean, too empty.\n\nKey Coaching Challenges: Rebuilding identity outside of motherhood, determining if marriage is salvageable, connecting with adult kids without being "too much," re-entering workforce after 20-year gap, managing resentment about giving up career, finding purpose and community at 53.\n\nWhat Patty Wants: To figure out who she is now, to feel needed and purposeful again, to know if her marriage is worth saving, to have her own interests and identity, to connect with adult kids authentically, to not feel like the last 20 years were wasted.\n\nClient Presentation Style: Warm and articulate, apologetic for feeling "silly," uses parenting analogies, self-deprecating, tries not to cry but sometimes does, careful and diplomatic when discussing Tom, minimizes own disappointment, quickly shifts to gratitude.	3	Medium	{#empty-nest,#identity-crisis,#marriage-stagnation,#purpose,#midlife-transition,#motherhood,#career-gap,#loneliness,#reinvention,#grief}	{"Empty nest syndrome","Identity crisis","Marriage stagnation","Purpose and reinvention"}	{"Warm and maternal, defined herself by motherhood","Organized and capable but currently lost","People-pleaser who never developed own identity","Nostalgic, struggles with change","Self-sacrificing to a fault","Pragmatic but currently emotional"}	Grieving loss of active motherhood role, identity crisis: "Who am I if I'm not needed?", lonely in own home, resentful toward husband but guilty about feeling that way, afraid to admit she's unhappy, panicked about "the rest of her life"	{"the_kids": {"son_michael": {"age": 25, "name": "Michael", "status": "Just got engaged, moving in with fiancée", "wedding": "Fiancée is planning wedding, Patty feels excluded", "relationship": "Calls occasionally but has own life"}, "daughter_emma": {"age": 27, "name": "Emma", "distance": "Patty feels shut out of her life", "location": "Moved across country for job last year", "relationship": "Seems annoyed when Patty calls too often"}, "current_reality": "Kids call occasionally but have their own lives", "patty_past_role": "Was intensely involved in their lives - volunteered at schools, drove everywhere, was the 'mom friend'"}, "social_life": {"house": "Too quiet, too clean, too empty", "isolation": "Few real friends outside of mom role", "friend_group": "Was all 'kid moms'", "current_status": "They drifted when kids left"}, "life_trajectory": {"career": "Had promising career as office manager", "return": "Never went back", "leaving": "Left workforce when pregnant with Emma 'temporarily'", "reality": "Instead feels purposeless", "expectation": "Thought she'd feel free when kids left", "current_state": "No career, no recent work experience, feels unemployable", "identity_shift": "Entire identity became 'mom'"}, "marriage_to_tom": {"ages": "Met at 24, married at 25", "duration": "28 years", "intimacy": "Haven't been intimate in over a year", "connection": "Doesn't know if they even like each other anymore", "early_years": "Had kids immediately (daughter at 26, son at 28)", "spouse_name": "Tom", "current_state": "Haven't had real conversation in years", "daily_reality": "Watch TV in separate rooms most nights", "patty_question": "Is marriage salvageable or just going through motions?", "relationship_quality": "Marriage was 'fine' but centered around kids"}}	{"core_conflicts": ["Entire identity was motherhood, now that's gone", "Marriage is more roommate than partnership", "No career, no recent work experience, feels unemployable", "Friend group was all kid moms - they drifted", "Doesn't know what she likes or wants", "Afraid of next 30 years looking like this", "Deep resentment toward Tom for having career while she gave up hers", "Guilt about feeling unhappy when she 'has everything'"], "contributing_factors": ["Sacrificed career for kids without plan to return", "Never developed identity outside of mom role", "Marriage became about kids, not partnership", "Society/family expected her to be fulfilled by motherhood alone", "Didn't maintain friendships outside of parenting", "Tom has career/identity, she has nothing separate", "Kids growing up was inevitable but she didn't prepare"]}	Michael announced engagement, Patty cried (happy tears). Later that night realized she was also crying for herself. Fiancée asked Emma to be maid of honor, not Patty (tradition). Patty felt devastated and couldn't explain why.

For the last 5+ years, he was verbally abusive when drunk—never physical, but said terrible things to his wife Linda and kids Ashley (19) and Tyler (16). His rock bottom: showed up drunk to Tyler's championship basketball game, made a scene, Tyler played terribly and said "I fucking hate you" on the way home. Linda said "Get help or get out." He went to his first AA meeting the next day. Now he's sober but the damage remains: Ashley barely speaks to him, Tyler won't make eye contact, and Linda is in therapy deciding whether to leave. They're in a "trial separation" living in same house (separate rooms). At Tyler's recent birthday dinner, Rob gave a heartfelt apology—Tyler said "Thanks" flatly and barely looked at him. That night Rob heard Linda crying in her room and ended up in a bar parking lot for an hour before calling his sponsor instead of going in.\n\nKey Coaching Challenges: Proving change through actions not just words, repairing relationships with kids who don't trust him, determining if Linda will ever forgive him, being emotional/vulnerable without alcohol, making amends beyond apologizing, managing guilt without drowning, respecting family's timeline for trust.\n\nWhat Rob Wants: To repair relationship with Linda if it's not too late, to earn kids' trust back, to learn how to be present and emotional without drinking, to show them he's changed through actions, to forgive himself while respecting their timeline, to not fuck up his sobriety.\n\nClient Presentation Style: Direct and practical, uses construction/work metaphors, "just tell me what to do," straightforward no-BS, voice cracks talking about kids, uncomfortable showing vulnerability, takes full responsibility without excuses, action-focused and persistent, wants concrete tools.	5	Hard	{#sobriety,#addiction-recovery,#verbal-abuse,#family-repair,#trust-rebuilding,#amends,#parenting,#marriage-crisis,#AA,#generational-trauma}	{"Sobriety maintenance","Family trust repair","Verbal abuse recovery","Emotional vulnerability"}	{"Blue-collar, straightforward communicator","Prideful but currently humbled","Loyal once you earn it, but trust is hard to rebuild","Gruff exterior, soft interior","Action-oriented, uncomfortable with emotions","Trying hard but doesn't know what he's doing"}	8 months sober, taking it day by day, proud of sobriety but terrified of slipping, deeply ashamed of past behavior, desperate to fix his family but doesn't know how, raw and emotional (new for him - used to drink feelings away), hopeful but scared it's too late	{"the_kids": {"son_tyler": {"age": 16, "name": "Tyler", "status": "Lives at home", "behavior": "Won't look him in the eye", "demeanor": "Angry and distant"}, "kids_alliance": "Kids side with Linda (he doesn't blame them)", "family_dinners": "Family dinners are silent and painful", "witness_trauma": "Both witnessed years of drunk Rob yelling", "daughter_ashley": {"age": 19, "name": "Ashley", "stance": "Has told him she's 'done' with him", "status": "Away at college", "relationship": "Barely speaks to him"}}, "the_drinking": {"peak": "By end, drinking 8-10 beers a night plus whiskey on weekends", "cycle": "Woke up with guilt, drank to forget", "pattern": "Started socially, became daily habit", "routine": "Used to come home and immediately crack beer", "targets": "Called Linda names, belittled the kids", "duration": "Pattern went on for 5+ years", "sobriety": "8 months sober now", "drunk_behavior": "Would get mean when drunk, say awful things"}, "marriage_to_linda": {"ages": "Met at 28, married at 29", "duration": "22 years", "violence": "Never physical but said terrible things", "her_stance": "Linda stayed 'for the kids' but now they're older", "her_therapy": "She's in therapy deciding if she should leave", "spouse_name": "Linda", "last_5_years": "Last 5 years were hell for everyone", "verbal_abuse": "He was verbally abusive when drunk", "first_10_years": "First 10 years were good", "current_arrangement": "'Trial separation' living in same house (separate rooms)", "drinking_escalation": "Then drinking escalated"}, "rock_bottom_moment": {"event": "Tyler had big basketball game", "scene": "Made scene in stands, Tyler saw it", "ride_home": "On way home, Tyler said 'I fucking hate you'", "rob_state": "Showed up drunk", "rob_action": "Went to first AA meeting next day", "time_since": "Been sober 8 months since", "linda_ultimatum": "That night Linda said 'Get help or get out'", "tyler_performance": "Tyler played terribly, devastated"}}	{"core_conflicts": ["Sobriety is first step, repairing damage is harder", "Doesn't know how to show up sober (always hid behind drinking)", "Years of verbal abuse can't be erased with apologies", "Linda is emotionally checked out, might leave anyway", "Kids don't trust him, he has to earn it back", "Facing emotions without alcohol is overwhelming", "Terrified he'll drink again if family leaves"], "contributing_factors": ["Used alcohol to cope with emotions for decades", "Never learned emotional expression or vulnerability", "Verbal abuse created deep wounds in family", "Kids' development shaped by drunk, angry dad", "Linda exhausted from years of emotional abuse", "Family has learned to function without him", "His sobriety doesn't undo the damage"]}	Tyler's 17th birthday dinner (few days ago).

Trevor is spiraling: checks if she's read messages constantly, panics if she doesn't respond within an hour, overanalyzes emoji usage, screenshots conversations to analyze with friends, and has drafted/deleted approximately 1000 texts. This is his pattern—previous relationships ended because he was "too clingy" and "exhausting." When Amber didn't text back for 6 hours (she was in meetings), Trevor sent 4 increasingly anxious texts.

e19138ac-2c3f-403b-aadb-09503bcf4d5f	Kerry Martin	kerry-martin	42	Female	she/her	Pediatric nurse	Married (trying to save it)	Kerry (42, pediatric nurse, married 12 years) discovered her husband Derek's 8-month affair with a coworker 4 months ago. They were high school sweethearts who she thought had "forever" kind of love—two kids, solid family unit. She found suspicious texts, he initially lied, then confessed everything. The other woman knew he was married. Derek ended it, swears it's over, and wants to rebuild. Kerry agreed to try but doesn't know if she can ever trust him again. She's in individual therapy and they're in couples therapy, but she's living in constant surveillance mode: checks his phone, tracks his location, spirals when he's 30 minutes late (recently happened, she found nothing but felt terrible for checking). She oscillates between thinking they can make it and wanting to leave. Her family/church pressure her to "forgive" quickly, while she's still processing devastation. She can't decide if staying is strength or weakness, and she's exhausted from constantly investigating.\n\nKey Coaching Challenges: Determining if trust can be rebuilt after affair, stopping constant surveillance and checking, managing triggers (phone, late nights, mentions of coworker), knowing if she's healing or numbing, protecting kids while processing own pain, making decision that's hers not everyone else's.\n\nWhat Kerry Wants: To know if she can truly forgive and rebuild trust, to stop obsessing over where he is and who he's with, to feel secure in marriage again, to make the right decision for HER, to protect kids while healing, to stop feeling like she's constantly investigating, clarity on whether to stay or go.\n\nClient Presentation Style: Articulate and thoughtful, uses medical/nursing analogies, measured and intentional, composed exterior, voice gets quiet when hurting, "I don't know" becomes frequent phrase, controlled but seething when angry, cautious and tentative when hopeful.	4	Medium-Hard	{#affair-recovery,#infidelity,#trust-issues,#betrayal,#marriage-crisis,#triggers,#forgiveness,#surveillance,#decision-making,#trauma}	{"Affair recovery","Trust rebuilding","Betrayal trauma","Decision paralysis"}	{"Compassionate and giving (at work and home)","Deeply hurt but trying to process constructively","Spiritual, relies on faith for strength","Strong sense of right and wrong","Articulate about emotions but struggling with conflicting feelings","Determined but exhausted from the effort"}	Devastated by husband's affair, oscillating between wanting to save marriage and wanting to leave, angry but trying not to be consumed by it, questioning everything she thought she knew, lonely even though not alone, uncertain if she can ever trust him again	{"the_kids": {"impact": "Trying to keep things 'normal' for them - exhausting", "disclosure": "Haven't told kids explicitly but tension is obvious", "son_jordan": {"age": 6, "name": "Jordan", "awareness": "Too young to fully understand"}, "daughter_naomi": {"age": 9, "name": "Naomi", "awareness": "Asking why mommy's been sad"}, "keisha_concern": "Pretending everything's fine is draining"}, "the_affair": {"type": "Emotional and physical", "duration": "8 months", "derek_claim": "Swears it's completely over", "other_woman": "Coworker who knew Derek was married", "derek_honesty": "Initially lied, then confessed everything", "keisha_belief": "Doesn't fully believe him", "current_status": "Ended when Keisha found out", "discovery_method": "Keisha found suspicious texts"}, "current_state": {"church": "Everyone at church thinks they're fine", "privacy": "Haven't told many people (shame, privacy)", "support": "Best friend knows, says 'whatever you decide, I support you'", "therapy": "In individual therapy (started immediately after finding out)", "daily_reality": "Some days thinks they can make it, other days wants to leave", "couples_therapy": "Also in couples therapy together", "family_pressure": "Family/church pressure to 'forgive' quickly"}, "marriage_to_derek": {"history": "High school sweethearts, married at 20", "duration": "22 years", "discovery": "Found out about affair 4 months ago through suspicious texts", "pre_affair": "Thought they had 'forever' kind of love, two kids, seemed like solid family unit", "his_actions": "Ended affair when discovered, wants to rebuild", "spouse_name": "Derek", "his_response": "Initially lied, then confessed everything", "keisha_choice": "Agreed to try but doesn't know if she can"}}	{"core_conflicts": ["Doesn't know if she can ever trust him again", "Loves him but also resents him deeply", "Pressure from family/church to 'forgive' quickly", "Triggers everywhere (his phone, late work nights, mentions of coworker)", "Doesn't know if staying is strength or weakness", "Identity crisis: thought she knew who they were as couple", "Afraid of modeling bad relationship for kids vs breaking up family"], "contributing_factors": ["High school sweethearts - entire adult life with him", "Deep religious/community pressure around marriage and forgiveness", "Kids create complexity and stakes", "Financial dependence considerations", "Fear of being judged for either staying or leaving", "Loss of naivety - can never go back to before", "Betrayal shattered sense of security and identity"]}	Derek was 30 minutes late from work (legitimate reason).

I'm Monica, and I'm going to be your guide through NBG - Next Booking Guidance. This is the most important skill you'll learn for retention. Let's start with the basics."\n\n### What is NBG?\n\nNBG stands for **Next Booking Guidance** - it's the framework you use at the END of a session to secure ongoing work with your client.\n\n**Video: Monica explains the 3 steps**\n"NBG has three steps that always happen in this order:\n\n1. **Future Work** - Paint the picture of what you'll work on together\n2. **Booking** - Lock in the next session time  \n3. **Purchase** - Confirm their coaching plan investment\n\nThink of it like a conveyor belt - each step naturally leads to the next."\n\n### Monica's Question #1:\n"Why does the order matter? What happens if you try to get payment BEFORE booking a time?"\n\n**Multiple Choice:**\n- A) Nothing - the order doesn't really matter\n- B) Clients feel less committed because there's no concrete appointment anchoring their decision\n- C) It's just a preference, not a rule\n- D) Booking first is just tradition\n\n**Correct Answer:** B\n\n**Monica's Explanation:**\n"YES! When someone has a specific time on their calendar, they've mentally committed to continuing. Payment becomes the natural next step. But if you ask for payment first without a concrete appointment? That's a scary decision point that invites hesitation."\n\n### Monica's Question #2:\n"You just had a great session with a client. When should you START the NBG process?"\n\n**Multiple Choice:**\n- A) Right at the beginning to set expectations\n- B) Whenever the client brings it up\n- C) With 10-15 minutes remaining in the session\n- D) After they ask about next steps\n\n**Correct Answer:** C\n\n**Monica's Explanation:**\n"EXACTLY! You need 10-15 minutes to do NBG properly. Start too late and you'll rush or go overtime. Start too early and the coaching feels incomplete. With 10-15 minutes left, you wrap up the coaching content naturally and transition into NBG."\n\n### Monica's Question #3:\n"A client just had a breakthrough in your session. They're feeling hopeful and energized. This is the perfect moment to..."\n\n**Multiple Choice:**\n- A) Let them sit with it and reach out when they're ready\n- B) Transition into NBG and secure the next session\n- C) Send them a calendar link to book when convenient\n- D) Wait to see if they bring up continuing\n\n**Correct Answer:** B\n\n**Monica's Explanation:**\n"YES! Clients are MOST likely to commit when they're coming out of a great session feeling hopeful. That's peak buying energy. Don't let that moment pass - guide them into the next steps while they're feeling the value."\n\n### The Mindset\n\n**Video: Monica's Key Point**\n"Here's what shifts everything: NBG isn't separate from coaching - it's an EXTENSION of the care you've shown all session. You're not 'switching to business mode.' You're helping them commit to their own growth.\n\nWhen you genuinely believe coaching will help this client - which you should - then guiding them through NBG isn't pushy. It's leadership. It's serving them."\n\n### What You'll Learn Next\n\n"Now that you understand WHAT NBG is and WHY it matters, you're going to see what good NBG looks like in action with a real client. Let's meet Kerry..."\n\n	\N	\N	\N	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/haikei-waves-blue/waves-07.png	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/character-profiles/monica-profile.png	Monica	\N	\N	f	\N

Pay attention to what they say RIGHT BEFORE they start talking about future work."\n\n### Video Clip A (Complete Opening):\n*Coach says:* "So what we've uncovered today is that your anxiety around dating is really about fear of losing yourself like you did with Paul. [SUMMARY] I know how exhausting it's been - feeling like you're walking on eggshells, rehearsing conversations in your head. [FEELINGS] I know how important it is for you to date without losing yourself. [GOAL] So here's what our work together will look like going forward..."\n\n### Video Clip B (Missing Feelings):\n*Coach says:* "So we talked about your dating anxiety and how it connects to your past relationship. [SUMMARY] You want to be able to date confidently. [GOAL] So here's what we'll work on..."\n\n### Video Clip C (Missing Goal):\n*Coach says:* "So you're struggling with anxiety when dating because of what happened with Paul. [SUMMARY] I know that's been really hard on you. [FEELINGS] So here's the plan..."\n\n### Monica's Question:\n"Which coach gave the MOST complete opening? What did the other coaches forget to include?"\n\n**Choices:**\n- A) Coach A - they covered everything\n- B) Coach B - they just needed to add feelings  \n- C) Coach C - they forgot the goal\n\n**Correct Answer:** A\n\n**Feedback if wrong:** "Let's watch Coach A again. Notice how they covered THREE things before transitioning: what they uncovered (summary), how the client feels (feelings), and what the client wants (goal). That's what makes it complete!"\n\n### Key Learning:\nThe 4 required elements of Opening are:\n1. Summary & Analysis\n2. Feelings Reflection\n3. Goal Reflection\n4.

Both coaches are correct about the content, but one will build WAY more connection."\n\n### Video Side-by-Side:\n\n**Coach 1 (Generic):**\n"I know this relationship has been hard on you and you want things to get better."\n\n**Coach 2 (Specific):**\n"I know how difficult it's been since that fight with Jake last Tuesday - feeling like you're walking on eggshells every time you try to bring up your needs, that pit in your stomach every time his name pops up on your phone."\n\n### Monica's Question:\n"Which coach will make the client feel MORE understood?"\n\n**Answer:** Coach 2\n\n### Monica's Follow-up:\n"What's the difference between these two? What did Coach 2 include that Coach 1 didn't?"\n\n### Discovery Prompt:\n*Identify the specific elements Coach 2 used:*\n- "that fight with Jake last Tuesday" → [Specific Event]\n- "Jake" → [Name]\n- "walking on eggshells" → [Client's Words]\n- "pit in your stomach" → [Physical Feeling]\n- "every time his name pops up" → [Specific Situation]\n\n### Monica's Summary:\n"YES! Coach 2 used the client's actual name, referenced a specific event from their conversation, and used language the client actually said. That's what specificity means - and it's what makes clients feel SEEN."\n	\N	\N	\N	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/haikei-waves-blue/waves-07.png	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/character-profiles/monica-profile.png	Monica	\N	\N	f	\N

She said she's been 'a hermit' for the past year, and she's afraid to put herself back out there. She wants to find a healthy relationship."\n\n### Monica's Question:\n"Write a feelings reflection for Alexia. Use her specific details."\n\n**Student types their answer**\n\n### Evaluation Criteria:\n- ✅ Includes "Paul" by name\n- ✅ Includes "hermit" (her word)\n- ✅ References specific situation (ghosting after 3 dates)\n- ✅ Names her specific fear (putting herself back out there)\n\n### Example Strong Answer:\n"I know how discouraging it's been putting yourself out there after being a hermit for so long - finally getting the courage to go on those dates with Paul, feeling like things were going well, and then having him ghost you out of nowhere. That kind of rejection after being vulnerable is crushing."\n\n### Feedback:\n- If missing name: "Don't forget to use Paul's name - that shows you were listening!"\n- If missing "hermit": "She called herself a 'hermit' - using her exact words builds connection"\n- If too generic: "Let's be more specific. What exactly happened with Paul that hurt?"\n	\N	\N	\N	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/haikei-waves-blue/waves-07.png	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/character-profiles/monica-profile.png	Monica	\N	\N	f	\N

I'm 36, I'm a pediatric nurse, and... four months ago I found out my husband Derek was having an affair. We're trying to work through it, but honestly? I don't know if I can ever trust him again. I'm exhausted from constantly checking his phone, tracking where he is. I just need to know if we can really rebuild from this, or if I'm wasting my time."\n\n**Cut to Monica**\n"Kerry just finished her first session with a coach. They talked about the affair, the surveillance mode she's living in, and her fear that she can't make the right decision. Now watch what happens at the end of the session..."\n\n---\n\n### Scenario 1: Future Work\n\n**Video: Coach delivers Future Work**\n"Kerry, what we've uncovered today is really important. The constant checking - his phone, his location, spiraling when he's late - that's not really about whether Derek is trustworthy. It's about whether YOU can feel safe again. And I know how exhausting that's been - that pit in your stomach every time he's 30 minutes late, feeling terrible after checking his phone even when you find nothing. You want to know if trust can actually be rebuilt, or if you're just prolonging something that's already broken.\n\nSo here's what our work together will look like going forward: First, we need to figure out what trust rebuilding actually looks like for you - not what your family or church says, but what YOU need to feel safe. Then, we'll work on managing those triggers without spiraling into surveillance mode every time something feels off. And finally, we'll help you get clarity on whether staying is right for you, so you can make a decision you feel confident about - not one driven by exhaustion or pressure.\n\nI know how much it matters to you to make the right choice for yourself and your kids - not to waste more time if this can't be fixed, but also not to give up on something salvageable. I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident we can get you that clarity. How does that sound?"\n\n**Cut to Monica**\n"Okay, let's break down what just happened. What did the coach do FIRST in Future Work?"\n\n**Multiple Choice:**\n- A) Jumped straight into the 3-point plan\n- B) Summarized what they uncovered in the session\n- C) Asked Kerry what she wanted to work on\n- D) Started booking the next session\n\n**Correct Answer:** B\n\n**Monica's Explanation:**\n"EXACTLY! The coach started with a summary - pulling together everything from the session into one clear insight. This creates the perfect foundation for the Game Plan. It shows Kerry 'I was listening, I understand what's really going on.'"\n\n---\n\n### Monica's Question #2:\n"What made the coach's language feel personal to Kerry versus generic?"\n\n**Multiple Choice:**\n- A) They used her name throughout\n- B) They referenced specific details: Derek, the phone checking, the 30-minutes-late incident, her church\n- C) They spoke slowly and clearly\n- D) They asked if she understood\n\n**Correct Answer:** B\n\n**Monica's Explanation:**\n"YES! Specificity builds connection. When the coach mentioned Derek by name, referenced the exact 30-minute incident, brought up the phone checking and her church's pressure - Kerry hears HERSELF in the coach's words. That's what makes clients feel truly understood."\n\n---\n\n### Monica's Question #3:\n"The coach said 'First... Then... And finally...' when describing the 3 points. Why does organization matter?"\n\n**Multiple Choice:**\n- A) It doesn't - clients just care about the content\n- B) It makes the plan feel random and overwhelming\n- C) It helps clients see how the steps connect and build on each other\n- D) It's just a stylistic choice\n\n**Correct Answer:** C\n\n**Monica's Explanation:**\n"EXACTLY! When you organize your 3 points with a clear relationship - like First → Then → Finally - clients can follow the logic. They see how each step leads naturally to the next. Without organization, it just sounds like a random list."\n\n---\n\n### Scenario 2: Booking\n\n**Video: Coach transitions to booking**\n"Wonderful, Kerry - I'm really looking forward to working through this with you. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books. I want to see you early next week so we can start figuring out what trust rebuilding looks like for you specifically - before you have another moment like that 30-minutes-late incident where you spiral. Does Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday work better for you?"\n\n**Kerry:** "Um... I'm not sure. I need to check my schedule, work has been really unpredictable."\n\n**Coach:** "I totally understand - schedules can be hectic. Let's do this: let's just put something in the books since my schedule fills up pretty quickly, and we can always move it if you need to once you check your calendar. That way we at least have something secured. Does Tuesday or Wednesday generally work better for you?"\n\n**Kerry:** "Tuesday is usually better."\n\n**Coach:** "Perfect! On Tuesday I have 10am, 2pm, and 5pm available. What time works best for your schedule?"\n\n**Kerry:** "2pm should work."\n\n**Coach:** "Excellent - I've got you locked in for Tuesday at 2pm."\n\n**Cut to Monica**\n\n---\n\n### Monica's Question #4:\n"Kerry hesitated about her schedule. What did the coach do?"\n\n**Multiple Choice:**\n- A) Gave up and said "just let me know when you can"\n- B) Pressured her to book immediately\n- C) Offered a placeholder that can be moved if needed\n- D) Sent a calendar link\n\n**Correct Answer:** C\n\n**Monica's Explanation:**\n"YES! The placeholder strategy is GOLD. When clients hesitate, you don't give up - you book something flexible. Once it's on their calendar, they're much more likely to keep it or reschedule than to completely ghost you."\n\n---\n\n### Monica's Question #5:\n"Notice the coach's rationale for booking next week: 'before you have another moment like that 30-minutes-late incident.' Why does specific rationale matter?"\n\n**Multiple Choice:**\n- A) It doesn't - timing is timing\n- B) Generic phrases like 'keep momentum going' work just as well  \n- C) Specific rationale ties booking to her actual urgent need, making the timing feel necessary\n- D) It just sounds more professional\n\n**Correct Answer:** C\n\n**Monica's Explanation:**\n"EXACTLY! 'Keep momentum going' is vague and forgettable. But 'before you have another spiral moment' connects directly to Kerry's pain. It makes booking now feel relevant and necessary, not arbitrary."\n\n---\n\n### What You've Learned\n\n**Monica's Summary:**\n"You just saw effective NBG in action:\n- Future Work that feels personal and specific\n- Organized 3-point plan with 'we' language\n- Booking with specific rationale tied to urgent need\n- Placeholder strategy when client hesitates\n\nNow you're ready to try it yourself with Kerry - first with help, then on your own."\n\n	\N	\N	\N	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/haikei-waves-blue/waves-07.png	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/character-profiles/monica-profile.png	Monica	\N	\N	f	\N

Then, rebuilding your confidence in communication. And finally, addressing the self-blame pattern driving this.

Which one?"\n\n### Coach A (No Organization):\n"We'll work on your dating confidence, your boundaries with your ex, and your attachment patterns."\n\n### Coach B (Sequential Organization):\n"FIRST, we'll establish boundaries with your ex so you can stop getting pulled back in. THEN, once those boundaries protect your recovery, we'll work on rebuilding your dating confidence. And FINALLY, we'll address the attachment patterns so this doesn't repeat in your next relationship."\n\n### Coach C (Complementary Organization):\n"We'll work on three complementary areas: boundaries to protect your progress, dating confidence to get you back out there, and attachment work to ensure long-term success. Each of these supports your goal of finding a healthy relationship in a different way."\n\n### Monica's Question:\n"Which game plan feels most organized and compelling?"\n\n### Monica's Teaching:\n"YES! B shows SEQUENCE - one step leads to the next. C shows CONNECTION - how each piece supports the goal. Both work! The key is your 3 points can't just be a random list - they need RELATIONSHIP to each other."\n\n### Organization Options:\n1. **First → Then → Last** (sequential steps)\n2. **Short Term → Medium Term → Long Term** (timeline)\n3. **Surface → Digging Deeper** (increasing depth)\n4. **Immediate → Medium → Big Picture** (zooming out)\n5. **Complementary** (explain how each supports the goal differently)\n	\N	\N	\N	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/haikei-waves-blue/waves-07.png	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/character-profiles/monica-profile.png	Monica	\N	\N	f	\N

You can start exploring what you want in a relationship. You should figure out how to communicate your needs."\n\n### Coach 2:\n"We'll work together on setting those boundaries so you feel protected. We're going to explore what you really want in a relationship and get you that clarity. We'll figure out how to communicate your needs in a way that feels authentic to you."\n\n### Monica's Question:\n"One of these coaches will get the booking. One probably won't. Which one books the client?"\n\n**Answer:** Coach 2\n\n### Monica's Teaching:\n"EXACTLY! Coach 1 sounds like they're giving homework. Coach 2 sounds like they're IN IT with the client. When you use 'we' language, clients understand that your continued involvement is PART OF THE PLAN. That's what drives booking."\n\n### The Rule:\n- ❌ "You'll need to..." → Solo homework framing\n- ❌ "You can start..." → Optional, client-driven\n- ❌ "You should..." → Advice, not partnership\n- ✅ "We'll work on..." → Collaborative\n- ✅ "We're going to..." → Presumptive partnership\n- ✅ "We'll figure out..." → Together\n	\N	\N	\N	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/haikei-waves-blue/waves-07.png	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/character-profiles/monica-profile.png	Monica	\N	\N	f	\N

Remember: start with the MOST URGENT."\n\n**Correct Answer:** B\n\n### Monica's Teaching:\n"Yes! The wedding is in 3 months. Jake needs clarity NOW - not deep attachment work.

I'm not sure. I need to check my schedule."\n**Coach:** "Oh okay. Just let me know when you figure it out!"\n*[Call ends. Client never books.]*\n\n### Monica: "Uh oh. What just happened?"\n\n### Scenario B - Coach Uses Placeholder:\n**Coach:** "Which day next week works best?"\n**Client:** "Um... I'm not sure. I need to check my schedule."\n**Coach:** "I totally understand. Let's do this - let's just put something in the books since my schedule fills up quickly, and we can always move it if something comes up. That way we at least have something secured. Does Tuesday or Wednesday generally work better for you?"\n**Client:** "Wednesday is usually better."\n**Coach:** "Perfect! Wednesday I have 11am, 2pm, and 5pm. Let's pencil you in for one of those..."\n*[Client books!]*\n\n### Monica's Question:\n"What did the second coach do differently?"\n\n**Multiple choice:**\n- A) Gave up and let the client think about it\n- B) Pressured the client to book immediately\n- C) Offered a placeholder that can be moved\n- D) Sent a calendar link\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n### Monica's Teaching:\n"EXACTLY! The placeholder strategy is your secret weapon. When someone hesitates, you don't give up - you book something flexible. Once it's on their calendar, they're MUCH more likely to keep it or reschedule than to completely ghost you."\n\n### The Placeholder Script:\n"I totally understand. Let's do this - let's just put something in the books since my schedule fills up quickly, and we can always move it if something comes up. That way we at least have something secured."\n\n### Why Placeholders Work:\n- Converts uncertainty into concrete action\n- Preserves momentum (once session ends without booking, follow-through drops dramatically)\n- Clients are more likely to keep/reschedule than proactively reach out later\n- Reduces mental burden on client\n	\N	\N	\N	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/haikei-waves-blue/waves-07.png	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/character-profiles/monica-profile.png	Monica	\N	\N	f	\N

Let's do this: let's just put something in the books since my schedule fills up pretty quickly, and we can always move it if you need to once you check your calendar. Does Thursday or Friday generally work better for you?"\n\n### Common Mistakes:\n❌ "Okay, just let me know when you figure it out" (giving up)\n❌ "You really should book now before I fill up" (pressure)\n❌ "Here's my calendar link, book when you can" (offloading)\n❌ "Do you want to just think about it?" (inviting no)\n\n### The Key Elements:\n1. Acknowledge: "I totally understand"\n2. Reframe: "Let's just put something in the books"\n3. Reassure: "We can always move it"\n4.

Watch what happens..."\n\n### Coach A (Menu Dump):\n"So we have a 5-session package for $900, a 10-session package for $1,650, and a 20-session package for $2,400. Which one sounds good to you?"\n*Client:* "Um... I don't know... that's a lot to think about..." [overwhelmed, delays decision]\n\n### Coach B (One Recommendation):\n"Based on the work we outlined - figuring out your boundaries with Jake, rebuilding communication confidence, and addressing that self-blame pattern - I recommend the 20-session package. This gives us the runway to tackle all three areas thoroughly. Sessions come out to $120/hour compared to $180 for single sessions. How does that sound?"\n*Client:* "Okay, that makes sense."\n\n### Monica's Question:\n"Which client is more likely to purchase?"\n\n**Answer:** Coach B's client\n\n### Monica's Analysis:\n"What did Coach A do that created overwhelm?"\n**Students identify:** Gave 3 options at once\n\n"What did Coach B do instead?"\n**Students identify:** Made ONE recommendation with clear reason\n\n### Monica's Teaching:\n"YES! Choice paralysis is real. When you give multiple options, the client has to COMPARE them - that's cognitive work that creates friction. One clear recommendation with rationale = simple decision. They just have to say yes or no to what you're suggesting."\n\n### The Rule:\n- ❌ Never present multiple packages at once\n- ❌ Never ask "which one do you want?"\n- ✅ Recommend ONE specific plan\n- ✅ Tie recommendation to their Future Work\n- ✅ Explain why THIS plan fits THEIR situation\n	\N	\N	\N	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/haikei-waves-blue/waves-07.png	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/character-profiles/monica-profile.png	Monica	\N	\N	f	\N

They're motivated and engaged. You have 5, 10, and 20-session packages. Which do you recommend?"\n\n**Choices:**\n- A) 5 sessions - don't want to overwhelm them\n- B) 10 sessions - nice middle ground\n- C) 20 sessions - give them what they need\n\n**Correct Answer:** C\n\n### Monica's Explanation:\n"Here's the business reality that new coaches often miss:\n\n**Clients are most likely to purchase when they're coming out of a great first session.** That's peak buying energy. If you recommend something smaller 'just in case,' you're leaving value on the table.\n\n**Longer packages = more time to provide value = higher retention.** With 20 sessions, you have runway to build rapport, handle setbacks, and see real transformation. With 5 sessions? You barely get started.\n\n**You can always explain why it's NOT the largest if that's true.** 'Normally I'd recommend our 20-session package, but based on [specific reason], I think 10 sessions makes more sense for you.' This actually builds rapport because it shows thoughtful tailoring."\n\n### The Principle:\nDefault to largest UNLESS there's a clear reason not to. And if you're NOT recommending the largest, mention it and explain why.\n	\N	\N	\N	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/haikei-waves-blue/waves-07.png	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/character-profiles/monica-profile.png	Monica	\N	\N	f	\N

They continued because the pacing was palatable.\n\nThis isn't misleading - you'll gladly share total if they ask. But leading with it scares people off before they understand the value.\n\nSince you genuinely believe coaching will help them, framing pricing in a way that makes them MORE likely to continue is actually serving them, not doing them a disservice."\n\n### The Formula:\n"With this package, sessions come out to $[X] per hour, compared to $[Y] for single sessions - so you're saving $[difference] every session."\n	\N	\N	\N	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/haikei-waves-blue/waves-07.png	https://cjwhhjhwheckbbbnryxh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/character-profiles/monica-profile.png	Monica	\N	\N	f	\N

This gives us the runway to work through all three areas thoroughly. We can't rush the attachment work, and as you start dating again, you'll need support navigating those moments when your ex texts or when someone new triggers old patterns."\n\n**Value:**\n"With this package, sessions come out to $120/hour compared to $200 for single sessions - you're saving $80 every time we meet."\n\n**Close:**\n"I'll go ahead and process your Coaching Plan now."\n\n**[If Devon says: "That's more than I was planning to spend..."]**\n\n**Handle Objection:**\n"I hear you on budget - that makes total sense.

The constant checking - his phone, his location, spiraling when he's late - that's not really about whether Derek is trustworthy. It's about whether YOU can feel safe again. And I know how exhausting that's been - that pit in your stomach every time he's 30 minutes late, feeling terrible after checking his phone even when you find nothing. You want to know if trust can actually be rebuilt, or if you're just prolonging something that's already broken.\\\\n\\\\nSo here's what our work together will look like going forward: First, we need to figure out what trust rebuilding actually looks like for you - not what your family or church says, but what YOU need to feel safe. Then, we'll work on managing those triggers without spiraling into surveillance mode every time something feels off. And finally, we'll help you get clarity on whether staying is right for you, so you can make a decision you feel confident about - not one driven by exhaustion or pressure.\\\\n\\\\nI know how much it matters to you to make the right choice for yourself and your kids - not to waste more time if this can't be fixed, but also not to give up on something salvageable. I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident we can get you that clarity.

& Analysis\\\\nWe uncovered that the text exchange after Riley told you about Stephanie’s boyfriend cracked something open that you’ve been holding down for months—your anger, your grief, and how blindsided you still feel by a 15-year marriage ending. Under the “I’m fine / I’m falling apart” swing, there’s a man who gave up big pieces of himself to try to keep the marriage alive, and who now isn’t sure who he is without the role of “Stephanie’s husband.” My key insight is that what feels like “being stuck” is actually you trying to grieve, parent, and rebuild an identity all at once, while everyone around you is rushing you to “move on.”\\\\n\\\\nFeelings Reflection\\\\nYou feel deeply sad and lonely, especially when you imagine Stephanie’s new boyfriend around your kids, and it stings that she seems to have moved on so quickly while you’re still clearing your throat trying not to cry. You’re angry—about her checking out emotionally years ago, about being told “You need to move on, Marcus” after you finally snapped—but you’ve learned to treat your own anger like it’s “inappropriate,” so you keep apologizing for it instead of trusting it. At the same time, you feel a quiet relief that the constant walking-on-eggshells is over, and then you feel guilty for that relief, which feeds the fear that you’re “damaged goods” or that the kids would be better off not seeing you hurt.\\\\n\\\\nGoal Reflection\\\\nYour main goals are to stop feeling stuck and sad all the time, figure out if you’re actually ready to date or just lonely, set solid boundaries with Stephanie, and be a present, stable dad even while you’re hurting. This matters to you because you don’t want to repeat the same patterns, you want your kids to experience you as grounded and emotionally honest, and you want to eventually find love again as Marcus—the whole person—not just as someone’s husband.\\\\n\\\\nTransition\\\\nSo here’s what our work together will look like going forward...\\",\\"is_error\\":false,\\"tool_has_been_called\\":true,\\"tool_latency_secs\\":0,\\"dynamic_variable_updates\\":[],\\"type\\":\\"system\\",\\"result\\":null}],\\"feedback\\":null,\\"llm_override\\":null,\\"time_in_call_secs\\":99,\\"conversation_turn_metrics\\":null,\\"rag_retrieval_info\\":null,\\"llm_usage\\":null,\\"interrupted\\":false,\\"original_message\\":null,\\"source_medium\\":null},{\\"role\\":\\"user\\",\\"agent_metadata\\":null,\\"message\\":\\"Summary & Analysis\\\\nWe uncovered that the text exchange after Riley told you about Stephanie’s boyfriend cracked something open that you’ve been holding down for months—your anger, your grief, and how blindsided you still feel by a 15-year marriage ending.

Stabilizing the Present: Grief, Anger & Co‑Parenting – [Immediate/Urgent]\\\\nWe’ll start by helping you feel more stable day-to-day so you’re not constantly bouncing between “I’m fine” and “I’m falling apart.” We’ll create a simple “grief and anger toolkit” just for you—ways to let yourself be sad and mad without feeling like a bad guy, and without stuffing it until it comes out in a text blow-up to Stephanie. We’ll also map out some concrete co-parenting moves: what’s okay for Stephanie to do (like sharing info about the boyfriend) and what needs to change, and we’ll script a few calm, firm responses you can use so you don’t have to improvise when you’re triggered—especially around Riley and your younger kid. This gives you immediate relief and helps you show up as the stable dad you want to be, even while you’re still grieving.\\\\n\\\\n2. Boundaries & Identity: “Marcus, Not Just Stephanie’s Ex” – [Medium Term]\\\\nOnce things feel a bit steadier, we’ll focus on building boundaries and rebuilding you. We’ll clarify where Stephanie is overstepping (e.g., late-night non-emergency texts, involving the boyfriend with the kids too fast, emotional leaning on you) and turn that into a small set of clear, enforceable boundaries—expanding on the “no texts after 9pm” win you’ve already had. Alongside this, we’ll actively reconstruct your identity outside of marriage: what you let go of to keep the peace (the gym, friendships, hobbies), what actually matters to Marcus Johnson at 42, and what kind of partner/father/friend you want to be now. We’ll use your self-deprecating humor without letting it hide your real needs, so you can feel like a whole person again, not just “the divorced history teacher.”\\\\n\\\\n3. Future Relationships: Readiness, Dating & Not Repeating Old Patterns – [Deeper/Long Term]\\\\nWith more emotional footing and clearer boundaries, we’ll explore the big question: “Am I lonely, or actually ready to date?” We’ll unpack the story that you’re “too old and damaged” and look at those two disastrous dates as data, not verdicts on your worth. We’ll define what “ready enough” looks like for you, so you don’t feel pushed into dating before you’re there, and we’ll identify the patterns from your marriage—like giving up parts of yourself, ignoring early red flags, doubting your own judgment—so you don’t re-create them with someone new. From there, we’ll slowly build your dating confidence: practicing honest conversations, trusting your read on people, and shaping a vision for a future relationship where you don’t disappear to keep the peace.\\",\\"is_error\\":false,\\"tool_has_been_called\\":true,\\"tool_latency_secs\\":0,\\"dynamic_variable_updates\\":[],\\"type\\":\\"system\\",\\"result\\":null}],\\"feedback\\":null,\\"llm_override\\":null,\\"time_in_call_secs\\":123,\\"conversation_turn_metrics\\":null,\\"rag_retrieval_info\\":null,\\"llm_usage\\":null,\\"interrupted\\":false,\\"original_message\\":null,\\"source_medium\\":null},{\\"role\\":\\"user\\",\\"agent_metadata\\":null,\\"message\\":\\"GAME PLAN\\\\n1.

Stabilizing the Present: Grief, Anger & Co‑Parenting – [Immediate/Urgent]\\nWe’ll start by helping you feel more stable day-to-day so you’re not constantly bouncing between “I’m fine” and “I’m falling apart.” We’ll create a simple “grief and anger toolkit” just for you—ways to let yourself be sad and mad without feeling like a bad guy, and without stuffing it until it comes out in a text blow-up to Stephanie. We’ll also map out some concrete co-parenting moves: what’s okay for Stephanie to do (like sharing info about the boyfriend) and what needs to change, and we’ll script a few calm, firm responses you can use so you don’t have to improvise when you’re triggered—especially around Riley and your younger kid. This gives you immediate relief and helps you show up as the stable dad you want to be, even while you’re still grieving.\\n\\n2. Boundaries & Identity: “Marcus, Not Just Stephanie’s Ex” – [Medium Term]\\nOnce things feel a bit steadier, we’ll focus on building boundaries and rebuilding you. We’ll clarify where Stephanie is overstepping (e.g., late-night non-emergency texts, involving the boyfriend with the kids too fast, emotional leaning on you) and turn that into a small set of clear, enforceable boundaries—expanding on the “no texts after 9pm” win you’ve already had. Alongside this, we’ll actively reconstruct your identity outside of marriage: what you let go of to keep the peace (the gym, friendships, hobbies), what actually matters to Marcus Johnson at 42, and what kind of partner/father/friend you want to be now. We’ll use your self-deprecating humor without letting it hide your real needs, so you can feel like a whole person again, not just “the divorced history teacher.”\\n\\n3. Future Relationships: Readiness, Dating & Not Repeating Old Patterns – [Deeper/Long Term]\\nWith more emotional footing and clearer boundaries, we’ll explore the big question: “Am I lonely, or actually ready to date?” We’ll unpack the story that you’re “too old and damaged” and look at those two disastrous dates as data, not verdicts on your worth. We’ll define what “ready enough” looks like for you, so you don’t feel pushed into dating before you’re there, and we’ll identify the patterns from your marriage—like giving up parts of yourself, ignoring early red flags, doubting your own judgment—so you don’t re-create them with someone new.

You've described this constant state of hypervigilance that's not only made it difficult for you to feel comfortable at home but really feel comfortable anywhere at all even at work where you're already managing tremendous pressure in your job and I understand how important it is to you to come to a conclusion about the direction of your marriage that you can feel good about. So here's what our work will look like together going forward. Number one is we have to figure out what boundaries do you need in your home? And number two, how do you want to use the space? How do you want to use the space? And number three, how can we make sure that our work is safe and secure for everyone else who's working on it? So that you can feel safe there. It's important that you have a space that feels like a safe zone for you amidst the chaos that's going on around you. Next, we'll figure out what the actual impact has been in your interpersonal bond with Derek. Is this something that we can come back from? Can trust be rebuilt? And from there, we'll zoom out and deal with the implications of that question. If trust can be rebuilt, we'll talk about how and we'll make the game plan for how to make that happen. And if we determine that trust can't be rebuilt, we talk about moving forward. Again, I know how important it is to you to have clarity on your next steps, and I'm here to guide you every step of the way to ensure that you come to a conclusion that you feel safe with and confident about.

So here's what our work will look like together going forward. Number one is we have to figure out what boundaries do you need in your home? And number two, how do you want to use the space? How do you want to use the space? And number three, how can we make sure that our work is safe and secure for everyone else who's working on it? So that you can feel safe there. It's important that you have a space that feels like a safe zone for you amidst the chaos that's going on around you. Next, we'll figure out what the actual impact has been in your interpersonal bond with Derek. Is this something that we can come back from? Can trust be rebuilt? And from there, we'll zoom out and deal with the implications of that question. If trust can be rebuilt, we'll talk about how and we'll make the game plan for how to make that happen. And if we determine that trust can't be rebuilt, we talk about moving forward.

You listened to his concerns and offered a solution that addressed them directly, securing the next step without making him feel pressured. Your tone was consistently supportive and understanding, which is crucial for building trust.Where there's an opportunity for even greater impact, as we discussed, is in the emotional resonance of your \\"Future Work\\" section, particularly the Game Plan. While your points were logical and well-structured, infusing them with more vivid, emotionally compelling language that directly mirrors Marcus's expressed feelings and desires would make the value of your coaching even more palpable. Think about painting a picture of the transformation he'll experience, rather than just outlining the steps. Also, ensuring your \\"Opening\\" fully captured his specific feelings and goals, using his own words, would further solidify that connection before you even present the Game Plan.Overall, you demonstrated a strong grasp of the NBG framework, and with a bit more focus on the emotional depth and specificity in your language, you'll be truly exceptional.

I'll alternate between:\\\\n\\\\nCoach dialogue (me as the coach),\\\\nClient responses (me as the client),\\\\nMentor commentary explaining what’s happening and why.\\\\n\\\\nI'll be playing Marcus Johnson, a forty-two-year-old high school history teacher. Riley told Marcus about Stephanie's boyfriend. Marcus handled it poorly - snapped at Stephanie over text for the first time expressing anger. Stephanie responded: \\\\\\"You need to move on, Marcus.\\\\\\" This prompted him to finally seek coaching after friends suggested it months ago. He's grieving the end of a fifteen-year marriage, angry but trying to suppress it, lonely and uncertain about his identity outside marriage, anxious about dating again, relieved but guilty about feeling relieved, and oscillating between \\\\\\"I'm fine\\\\\\" and \\\\\\"I'm falling apart.\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That was a lot. But I think I needed to hear it.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the client's natural closing-of-session line, based on his emotional state. I'm now entering the role of the coach to demonstrate the NBG.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Marcus, I know today was a tough session, and we really dug into some painful stuff. We talked about the shock and hurt you felt when Riley told you about Stephanie's new boyfriend, and how that led to you lashing out, which isn't like you. It's clear you're grieving the end of your fifteen-year marriage, and there's a lot of anger and confusion mixed in with that. You're feeling lost about who you are now, and anxious about what comes next, especially with dating. But we also uncovered that beneath all of that, there's a part of you that's ready to move forward and redefine your identity.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Summary and Analysis part of the Opening. I've summarized what Marcus shared, included an analysis of his emotional state, and highlighted his readiness for change, all using his specific context.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load right now, Marcus. That anger, the loneliness, the uncertainty – it's all very real and understandable given everything you've been through. It's okay to feel all of that, and it makes perfect sense why you'd be struggling with these emotions.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Feelings Reflection. I've acknowledged his emotions and validated them, connecting them directly to his situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Ultimately, what you're looking for is to navigate this divorce with more peace, rediscover your sense of self, and build a fulfilling future, whatever that looks like.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Goal Reflection. I've named his specific goal and the underlying motivation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Here's what our work together will look like going forward.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Transition to Game Plan. I'm using confident, presumptive language to guide him into the next phase.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>First, we're going to work on processing that anger and grief in a healthy way, so you can release some of that heavy emotional burden and stop feeling like you have to suppress everything. We'll give you tools to manage those intense feelings when they come up, so you can respond thoughtfully instead of reacting impulsively, like what happened with Stephanie.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the first point of the Game Plan. It's the most urgent and directly addresses his recent outburst and suppressed anger, using \\\\\\"we\\\\\\" language and tying it to his specific situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Next, we'll focus on rediscovering your identity outside of your marriage. We'll explore your passions, your values, and what truly makes you, Marcus, tick, so you can build a strong foundation for your new chapter and feel confident in who you are as an individual.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the second point. It's distinct from the first, building on the idea of emotional processing to focus on self-discovery.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>And finally, we'll develop strategies for navigating future relationships and dating. This isn't about rushing into anything, but about equipping you with the confidence and clarity to approach new connections in a way that feels authentic and safe for you, whenever you're ready.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the third point, completing the structured approach and addressing his anxiety about dating, while also respecting his timeline.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>So, we'll start by managing those immediate, intense emotions, then move into rebuilding your sense of self, and finally, prepare you for a confident future in relationships. Each step builds on the last, creating a clear path for you to move forward and build the life you want.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Organizational Structure explanation. I've clearly articulated how the three points are related and work together towards his goal.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That makes a lot of sense. It's... it's a lot to think about, but it sounds like a good plan.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is showing realistic engagement and buy-in after the Future Work.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Marcus, I know how much it means to you to find peace after this divorce, to feel like yourself again, and to build a future that you're genuinely excited about. You deserve to move forward with confidence and clarity, and I truly believe that's achievable for you.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Reiterate Goal Importance part of the Camaraderie Close. I've reflected his specific emotional stakes and why his goal matters to him.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident we can get there together. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Supportive Partnership + Buy-In. I've expressed confidence in him and our partnership, ending with the confident and casual \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Yeah, that sounds really good. I'm ready to... to start feeling better.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has given verbal buy-in. Now I'll transition to Booking.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Wonderful, Marcus – I'm really looking forward to continuing our work together. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Booking Transition. I've acknowledged his buy-in, used his name, and used presumptive language to move into booking.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I'd like to get you in early next week, ideally Monday or Tuesday, so we can start working on those tools to manage your anger and grief while everything from today's session is still fresh. That way, you can begin to feel some relief sooner rather than later.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Timeframe + Specific Rationale. I've suggested a broad timeframe with a specific rationale tied to his most urgent Game Plan point.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Hmm, early next week... I'd have to check my schedule. It's usually pretty packed with school stuff.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is showing hesitation, which is realistic. I'll use the placeholder strategy.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I totally understand, Marcus. Schedules can be hectic. Let's do this: let's just put something in the books since my schedule fills up pretty quickly, and we can always move it if you need to once you check your calendar. That way we at least have something secured and you're not scrambling to find a slot later. Does Monday or Tuesday generally work better for you?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Placeholder Strategy. I've acknowledged his concern and offered a flexible solution to secure a slot.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Tuesday is usually better for me.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has chosen a day.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Perfect! On Tuesday I have eleven AM, two PM, and six PM available. Which time works best for your schedule?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Share Available Slots. I've listed multiple options for the day he chose.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Two PM should work.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has selected a time.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Great – I've got you down as a placeholder for Tuesday at two PM. If you check your schedule and need to adjust it, just shoot me a message and we'll move it around. But at least now we have you locked in and you don't have to worry about my schedule filling up.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Lock in the Booking with Flexibility. I've confirmed the booking confidently, acknowledging the placeholder.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Okay, sounds good.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: Booking is complete. Now I'll transition to Purchase.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Great, I've got you set for Tuesday at two PM. Our final step is to confirm your Coaching Plan.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Purchase Transition. I've smoothly bridged from Booking to Purchase, using \\\\\\"Coaching Plan\\\\\\" terminology.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Based on our conversation today and the Game Plan we've outlined, I recommend our twelve-session Coaching Plan. This plan will give us the dedicated time we need to truly process your grief and anger, rediscover your identity, and build those confident relationship strategies without feeling rushed. It ensures we can go deep enough to create lasting change, rather than just scratching the surface.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Recommend Specific Plan + Rationale. I've recommended one specific plan and tied it directly to his goal and the Future Work plan, explaining why the number of sessions makes sense for his situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>With the twelve-session plan, your hourly rate comes down to one hundred fifty dollars per session, compared to two hundred dollars for a single session. So, you're saving six hundred dollars by committing to your growth with this plan.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Explain Financial Value. I've stated the hourly rate and compared it to the single-session rate, making the savings obvious without leading with the total price.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>This plan also includes installment options to make it more manageable, and you'll have access to text support between sessions for those moments when you need a quick check-in or have a question.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Mention Relevant Perks. I've briefly mentioned relevant perks that support the plan.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>One hundred fifty dollars a session... that's still a lot. I'm not sure I can swing that right now.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is expressing a price concern. I'll handle it by acknowledging and offering one alternative.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I understand that's a significant investment, Marcus. Your growth and well-being are absolutely worth it, and I want to make sure coaching is accessible for you. We could start with a six-session plan, which would still give us a solid foundation to begin processing your emotions and rediscovering your identity. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Handling Price Concern. I've acknowledged his concern and offered one alternative (a smaller plan) with a clear rationale, ending with \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\" and pausing.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>A six-session plan... that might be more doable. What would that look like?</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is open to the alternative.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>With the six-session plan, your hourly rate would be one hundred seventy-five dollars per session, and we could focus on those first two points of our Game Plan: processing your anger and grief, and starting to rediscover your identity. We can always extend it later if you feel it's right for you. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: I've provided details for the alternative plan and tied it back to the Game Plan.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Okay, yeah, that sounds better. I think I can do that.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has...\\",\\"multivoice_message\\":{\\"parts\\":[{\\"text\\":\\"I'll now demonstrate a full NBG conversation with this client.

I'll alternate between:\\\\n\\\\nCoach dialogue (me as the coach),\\\\nClient responses (me as the client),\\\\nMentor commentary explaining what’s happening and why.\\\\n\\\\nI'll be playing Marcus Johnson, a forty-two-year-old high school history teacher. Riley told Marcus about Stephanie's boyfriend. Marcus handled it poorly - snapped at Stephanie over text for the first time expressing anger. Stephanie responded: \\\\\\"You need to move on, Marcus.\\\\\\" This prompted him to finally seek coaching after friends suggested it months ago. He's grieving the end of a fifteen-year marriage, angry but trying to suppress it, lonely and uncertain about his identity outside marriage, anxious about dating again, relieved but guilty about feeling relieved, and oscillating between \\\\\\"I'm fine\\\\\\" and \\\\\\"I'm falling apart.\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That was a lot. But I think I needed to hear it.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the client's natural closing-of-session line, based on his emotional state. I'm now entering the role of the coach to demonstrate the NBG.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Marcus, I know today was a tough session, and we really dug into some painful stuff. We talked about the shock and hurt you felt when Riley told you about Stephanie's new boyfriend, and how that led to you lashing out, which isn't like you. It's clear you're grieving the end of your fifteen-year marriage, and there's a lot of anger and confusion mixed in with that. You're feeling lost about who you are now, and anxious about what comes next, especially with dating. But we also uncovered that beneath all of that, there's a part of you that's ready to move forward and redefine your identity.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Summary and Analysis part of the Opening. I've summarized what Marcus shared, included an analysis of his emotional state, and highlighted his readiness for change, all using his specific context.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load right now, Marcus. That anger, the loneliness, the uncertainty – it's all very real and understandable given everything you've been through. It's okay to feel all of that, and it makes perfect sense why you'd be struggling with these emotions.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Feelings Reflection. I've acknowledged his emotions and validated them, connecting them directly to his situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Ultimately, what you're looking for is to navigate this divorce with more peace, rediscover your sense of self, and build a fulfilling future, whatever that looks like.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Goal Reflection. I've named his specific goal and the underlying motivation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Here's what our work together will look like going forward.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Transition to Game Plan. I'm using confident, presumptive language to guide him into the next phase.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>First, we're going to work on processing that anger and grief in a healthy way, so you can release some of that heavy emotional burden and stop feeling like you have to suppress everything. We'll give you tools to manage those intense feelings when they come up, so you can respond thoughtfully instead of reacting impulsively, like what happened with Stephanie.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the first point of the Game Plan. It's the most urgent and directly addresses his recent outburst and suppressed anger, using \\\\\\"we\\\\\\" language and tying it to his specific situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Next, we'll focus on rediscovering your identity outside of your marriage. We'll explore your passions, your values, and what truly makes you, Marcus, tick, so you can build a strong foundation for your new chapter and feel confident in who you are as an individual.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the second point. It's distinct from the first, building on the idea of emotional processing to focus on self-discovery.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>And finally, we'll develop strategies for navigating future relationships and dating. This isn't about rushing into anything, but about equipping you with the confidence and clarity to approach new connections in a way that feels authentic and safe for you, whenever you're ready.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the third point, completing the structured approach and addressing his anxiety about dating, while also respecting his timeline.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>So, we'll start by managing those immediate, intense emotions, then move into rebuilding your sense of self, and finally, prepare you for a confident future in relationships. Each step builds on the last, creating a clear path for you to move forward and build the life you want.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Organizational Structure explanation. I've clearly articulated how the three points are related and work together towards his goal.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That makes a lot of sense. It's... it's a lot to think about, but it sounds like a good plan.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is showing realistic engagement and buy-in after the Future Work.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Marcus, I know how much it means to you to find peace after this divorce, to feel like yourself again, and to build a future that you're genuinely excited about. You deserve to move forward with confidence and clarity, and I truly believe that's achievable for you.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Reiterate Goal Importance part of the Camaraderie Close. I've reflected his specific emotional stakes and why his goal matters to him.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident we can get there together. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Supportive Partnership + Buy-In. I've expressed confidence in him and our partnership, ending with the confident and casual \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Yeah, that sounds really good. I'm ready to... to start feeling better.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has given verbal buy-in. Now I'll transition to Booking.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Wonderful, Marcus – I'm really looking forward to continuing our work together. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Booking Transition. I've acknowledged his buy-in, used his name, and used presumptive language to move into booking.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I'd like to get you in early next week, ideally Monday or Tuesday, so we can start working on those tools to manage your anger and grief while everything from today's session is still fresh. That way, you can begin to feel some relief sooner rather than later.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Timeframe + Specific Rationale. I've suggested a broad timeframe with a specific rationale tied to his most urgent Game Plan point.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Hmm, early next week... I'd have to check my schedule. It's usually pretty packed with school stuff.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is showing hesitation, which is realistic. I'll use the placeholder strategy.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I totally understand, Marcus. Schedules can be hectic. Let's do this: let's just put something in the books since my schedule fills up pretty quickly, and we can always move it if you need to once you check your calendar. That way we at least have something secured and you're not scrambling to find a slot later. Does Monday or Tuesday generally work better for you?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Placeholder Strategy. I've acknowledged his concern and offered a flexible solution to secure a slot.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Tuesday is usually better for me.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has chosen a day.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Perfect! On Tuesday I have eleven AM, two PM, and six PM available. Which time works best for your schedule?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Share Available Slots. I've listed multiple options for the day he chose.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Two PM should work.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has selected a time.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Great – I've got you down as a placeholder for Tuesday at two PM. If you check your schedule and need to adjust it, just shoot me a message and we'll move it around. But at least now we have you locked in and you don't have to worry about my schedule filling up.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Lock in the Booking with Flexibility. I've confirmed the booking confidently, acknowledging the placeholder.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Okay, sounds good.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: Booking is complete. Now I'll transition to Purchase.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Great, I've got you set for Tuesday at two PM. Our final step is to confirm your Coaching Plan.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Purchase Transition. I've smoothly bridged from Booking to Purchase, using \\\\\\"Coaching Plan\\\\\\" terminology.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Based on our conversation today and the Game Plan we've outlined, I recommend our twelve-session Coaching Plan. This plan will give us the dedicated time we need to truly process your grief and anger, rediscover your identity, and build those confident relationship strategies without feeling rushed. It ensures we can go deep enough to create lasting change, rather than just scratching the surface.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Recommend Specific Plan + Rationale. I've recommended one specific plan and tied it directly to his goal and the Future Work plan, explaining why the number of sessions makes sense for his situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>With the twelve-session plan, your hourly rate comes down to one hundred fifty dollars per session, compared to two hundred dollars for a single session. So, you're saving six hundred dollars by committing to your growth with this plan.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Explain Financial Value. I've stated the hourly rate and compared it to the single-session rate, making the savings obvious without leading with the total price.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>This plan also includes installment options to make it more manageable, and you'll have access to text support between sessions for those moments when you need a quick check-in or have a question.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Mention Relevant Perks. I've briefly mentioned relevant perks that support the plan.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>One hundred fifty dollars a session... that's still a lot. I'm not sure I can swing that right now.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is expressing a price concern. I'll handle it by acknowledging and offering one alternative.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I understand that's a significant investment, Marcus. Your growth and well-being are absolutely worth it, and I want to make sure coaching is accessible for you. We could start with a six-session plan, which would still give us a solid foundation to begin processing your emotions and rediscovering your identity. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Handling Price Concern. I've acknowledged his concern and offered one alternative (a smaller plan) with a clear rationale, ending with \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\" and pausing.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>A six-session plan... that might be more doable. What would that look like?</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is open to the alternative.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>With the six-session plan, your hourly rate would be one hundred seventy-five dollars per session, and we could focus on those first two points of our Game Plan: processing your anger and grief, and starting to rediscover your identity. We can always extend it later if you feel it's right for you. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: I've provided details for the alternative plan and tied it back to the Game Plan.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Okay, yeah, that sounds better. I think I can do that.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has confirmed.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Perfect – I'll go ahead and process your six-session Coaching Plan now.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Confident Close. I've used presumptive language with \\\\\\"Coaching Plan\\\\\\" wording.\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>That concludes the demonstration. I walked through the entire NBG sequence, from Future Work to Booking and Purchase, including handling a client's hesitation during booking and a price concern during purchase.\\\\n\\\\nThis demonstration was Gold Standard because:\\\\n- The Future Work was specific, emotionally resonant, and clearly structured, using \\\\\\"we\\\\\\" language and directly addressing Marcus's unique situation.\\\\n- The Booking process was smooth and presumptive, with a clear rationale for the timing and effective handling of his schedule hesitation using a placeholder.\\\\n- The Purchase recommendation was tailored to his needs, clearly articulated the value and perks, and effectively addressed his price concern by offering a suitable alternative.\\\\n\\\\nReady to try it yourself?

Riley told Marcus about Stephanie's boyfriend. Marcus handled it poorly - snapped at Stephanie over text for the first time expressing anger. Stephanie responded: \\\\\\"You need to move on, Marcus.\\\\\\" This prompted him to finally seek coaching after friends suggested it months ago. He's grieving the end of a fifteen-year marriage, angry but trying to suppress it, lonely and uncertain about his identity outside marriage, anxious about dating again, relieved but guilty about feeling relieved, and oscillating between \\\\\\"I'm fine\\\\\\" and \\\\\\"I'm falling apart.\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That was a lot. But I think I needed to hear it.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the client's natural closing-of-session line, based on his emotional state. I'm now entering the role of the coach to demonstrate the NBG.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Marcus, I know today was a tough session, and we really dug into some painful stuff. We talked about the shock and hurt you felt when Riley told you about Stephanie's new boyfriend, and how that led to you lashing out, which isn't like you. It's clear you're grieving the end of your fifteen-year marriage, and there's a lot of anger and confusion mixed in with that. You're feeling lost about who you are now, and anxious about what comes next, especially with dating. But we also uncovered that beneath all of that, there's a part of you that's ready to move forward and redefine your identity.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Summary and Analysis part of the Opening. I've summarized what Marcus shared, included an analysis of his emotional state, and highlighted his readiness for change, all using his specific context.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load right now, Marcus. That anger, the loneliness, the uncertainty – it's all very real and understandable given everything you've been through. It's okay to feel all of that, and it makes perfect sense why you'd be struggling with these emotions.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Feelings Reflection. I've acknowledged his emotions and validated them, connecting them directly to his situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Ultimately, what you're looking for is to navigate this divorce with more peace, rediscover your sense of self, and build a fulfilling future, whatever that looks like.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Goal Reflection. I've named his specific goal and the underlying motivation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Here's what our work together will look like going forward.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Transition to Game Plan. I'm using confident, presumptive language to guide him into the next phase.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>First, we're going to work on processing that anger and grief in a healthy way, so you can release some of that heavy emotional burden and stop feeling like you have to suppress everything. We'll give you tools to manage those intense feelings when they come up, so you can respond thoughtfully instead of reacting impulsively, like what happened with Stephanie.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the first point of the Game Plan. It's the most urgent and directly addresses his recent outburst and suppressed anger, using \\\\\\"we\\\\\\" language and tying it to his specific situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Next, we'll focus on rediscovering your identity outside of your marriage. We'll explore your passions, your values, and what truly makes you, Marcus, tick, so you can build a strong foundation for your new chapter and feel confident in who you are as an individual.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the second point. It's distinct from the first, building on the idea of emotional processing to focus on self-discovery.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>And finally, we'll develop strategies for navigating future relationships and dating. This isn't about rushing into anything, but about equipping you with the confidence and clarity to approach new connections in a way that feels authentic and safe for you, whenever you're ready.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the third point, completing the structured approach and addressing his anxiety about dating, while also respecting his timeline.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>So, we'll start by managing those immediate, intense emotions, then move into rebuilding your sense of self, and finally, prepare you for a confident future in relationships. Each step builds on the last, creating a clear path for you to move forward and build the life you want.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Organizational Structure explanation. I've clearly articulated how the three points are related and work together towards his goal.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That makes a lot of sense. It's... it's a lot to think about, but it sounds like a good plan.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is showing realistic engagement and buy-in after the Future Work.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Marcus, I know how much it means to you to find peace after this divorce, to feel like yourself again, and to build a future that you're genuinely excited about. You deserve to move forward with confidence and clarity, and I truly believe that's achievable for you.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Reiterate Goal Importance part of the Camaraderie Close. I've reflected his specific emotional stakes and why his goal matters to him.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident we can get there together. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Supportive Partnership + Buy-In. I've expressed confidence in him and our partnership, ending with the confident and casual \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Yeah, that sounds really good. I'm ready to... to start feeling better.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has given verbal buy-in. Now I'll transition to Booking.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Wonderful, Marcus – I'm really looking forward to continuing our work together. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Booking Transition. I've acknowledged his buy-in, used his name, and used presumptive language to move into booking.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I'd like to get you in early next week, ideally Monday or Tuesday, so we can start working on those tools to manage your anger and grief while everything from today's session is still fresh. That way, you can begin to feel some relief sooner rather than later.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Timeframe + Specific Rationale. I've suggested a broad timeframe with a specific rationale tied to his most urgent Game Plan point.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Hmm, early next week... I'd have to check my schedule. It's usually pretty packed with school stuff.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is showing hesitation, which is realistic. I'll use the placeholder strategy.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I totally understand, Marcus. Schedules can be hectic. Let's do this: let's just put something in the books since my schedule fills up pretty quickly, and we can always move it if you need to once you check your calendar. That way we at least have something secured and you're not scrambling to find a slot later. Does Monday or Tuesday generally work better for you?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Placeholder Strategy. I've acknowledged his concern and offered a flexible solution to secure a slot.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Tuesday is usually better for me.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has chosen a day.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Perfect! On Tuesday I have eleven AM, two PM, and six PM available. Which time works best for your schedule?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Share Available Slots. I've listed multiple options for the day he chose.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Two PM should work.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has selected a time.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Great – I've got you down as a placeholder for Tuesday at two PM. If you check your schedule and need to adjust it, just shoot me a message and we'll move it around. But at least now we have you locked in and you don't have to worry about my schedule filling up.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Lock in the Booking with Flexibility. I've confirmed the booking confidently, acknowledging the placeholder.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Okay, sounds good.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: Booking is complete. Now I'll transition to Purchase.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Great, I've got you set for Tuesday at two PM. Our final step is to confirm your Coaching Plan.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Purchase Transition. I've smoothly bridged from Booking to Purchase, using \\\\\\"Coaching Plan\\\\\\" terminology.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Based on our conversation today and the Game Plan we've outlined, I recommend our twelve-session Coaching Plan. This plan will give us the dedicated time we need to truly process your grief and anger, rediscover your identity, and build those confident relationship strategies without feeling rushed. It ensures we can go deep enough to create lasting change, rather than just scratching the surface.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Recommend Specific Plan + Rationale. I've recommended one specific plan and tied it directly to his goal and the Future Work plan, explaining why the number of sessions makes sense for his situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>With the twelve-session plan, your hourly rate comes down to one hundred fifty dollars per session, compared to two hundred dollars for a single session. So, you're saving six hundred dollars by committing to your growth with this plan.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Explain Financial Value. I've stated the hourly rate and compared it to the single-session rate, making the savings obvious without leading with the total price.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>This plan also includes installment options to make it more manageable, and you'll have access to text support between sessions for those moments when you need a quick check-in or have a question.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Mention Relevant Perks. I've briefly mentioned relevant perks that support the plan.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>One hundred fifty dollars a session... that's still a lot. I'm not sure I can swing that right now.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is expressing a price concern. I'll handle it by acknowledging and offering one alternative.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I understand that's a significant investment, Marcus. Your growth and well-being are absolutely worth it, and I want to make sure coaching is accessible for you. We could start with a six-session plan, which would still give us a solid foundation to begin processing your emotions and rediscovering your identity. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Handling Price Concern. I've acknowledged his concern and offered one alternative (a smaller plan) with a clear rationale, ending with \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\" and pausing.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>A six-session plan... that might be more doable. What would that look like?</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is open to the alternative.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>With the six-session plan, your hourly rate would be one hundred seventy-five dollars per session, and we could focus on those first two points of our Game Plan: processing your anger and grief, and starting to rediscover your identity. We can always extend it later if you feel it's right for you. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: I've provided details for the alternative plan and tied it back to the Game Plan.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Okay, yeah, that sounds better. I think I can do that.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has...\\",\\"multivoice_message\\":{\\"parts\\":[{\\"text\\":\\"I'll now demonstrate a full NBG conversation with this client.

I'll alternate between:\\\\n\\\\nCoach dialogue (me as the coach),\\\\nClient responses (me as the client),\\\\nMentor commentary explaining what’s happening and why.\\\\n\\\\nI'll be playing Marcus Johnson, a forty-two-year-old high school history teacher. Riley told Marcus about Stephanie's boyfriend. Marcus handled it poorly - snapped at Stephanie over text for the first time expressing anger. Stephanie responded: \\\\\\"You need to move on, Marcus.\\\\\\" This prompted him to finally seek coaching after friends suggested it months ago. He's grieving the end of a fifteen-year marriage, angry but trying to suppress it, lonely and uncertain about his identity outside marriage, anxious about dating again, relieved but guilty about feeling relieved, and oscillating between \\\\\\"I'm fine\\\\\\" and \\\\\\"I'm falling apart.\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That was a lot. But I think I needed to hear it.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the client's natural closing-of-session line, based on his emotional state. I'm now entering the role of the coach to demonstrate the NBG.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Marcus, I know today was a tough session, and we really dug into some painful stuff. We talked about the shock and hurt you felt when Riley told you about Stephanie's new boyfriend, and how that led to you lashing out, which isn't like you. It's clear you're grieving the end of your fifteen-year marriage, and there's a lot of anger and confusion mixed in with that. You're feeling lost about who you are now, and anxious about what comes next, especially with dating. But we also uncovered that beneath all of that, there's a part of you that's ready to move forward and redefine your identity.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Summary and Analysis part of the Opening. I've summarized what Marcus shared, included an analysis of his emotional state, and highlighted his readiness for change, all using his specific context.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load right now, Marcus. That anger, the loneliness, the uncertainty – it's all very real and understandable given everything you've been through. It's okay to feel all of that, and it makes perfect sense why you'd be struggling with these emotions.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Feelings Reflection. I've acknowledged his emotions and validated them, connecting them directly to his situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Ultimately, what you're looking for is to navigate this divorce with more peace, rediscover your sense of self, and build a fulfilling future, whatever that looks like.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Goal Reflection. I've named his specific goal and the underlying motivation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Here's what our work together will look like going forward.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Transition to Game Plan. I'm using confident, presumptive language to guide him into the next phase.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>First, we're going to work on processing that anger and grief in a healthy way, so you can release some of that heavy emotional burden and stop feeling like you have to suppress everything. We'll give you tools to manage those intense feelings when they come up, so you can respond thoughtfully instead of reacting impulsively, like what happened with Stephanie.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the first point of the Game Plan. It's the most urgent and directly addresses his recent outburst and suppressed anger, using \\\\\\"we\\\\\\" language and tying it to his specific situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Next, we'll focus on rediscovering your identity outside of your marriage. We'll explore your passions, your values, and what truly makes you, Marcus, tick, so you can build a strong foundation for your new chapter and feel confident in who you are as an individual.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the second point. It's distinct from the first, building on the idea of emotional processing to focus on self-discovery.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>And finally, we'll develop strategies for navigating future relationships and dating. This isn't about rushing into anything, but about equipping you with the confidence and clarity to approach new connections in a way that feels authentic and safe for you, whenever you're ready.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the third point, completing the structured approach and addressing his anxiety about dating, while also respecting his timeline.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>So, we'll start by managing those immediate, intense emotions, then move into rebuilding your sense of self, and finally, prepare you for a confident future in relationships. Each step builds on the last, creating a clear path for you to move forward and build the life you want.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Organizational Structure explanation. I've clearly articulated how the three points are related and work together towards his goal.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That makes a lot of sense. It's... it's a lot to think about, but it sounds like a good plan.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is showing realistic engagement and buy-in after the Future Work.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Marcus, I know how much it means to you to find peace after this divorce, to feel like yourself again, and to build a future that you're genuinely excited about. You deserve to move forward with confidence and clarity, and I truly believe that's achievable for you.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Reiterate Goal Importance part of the Camaraderie Close. I've reflected his specific emotional stakes and why his goal matters to him.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident we can get there together. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Supportive Partnership + Buy-In. I've expressed confidence in him and our partnership, ending with the confident and casual \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Yeah, that sounds really good. I'm ready to... to start feeling better.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has given verbal buy-in. Now I'll transition to Booking.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Wonderful, Marcus – I'm really looking forward to continuing our work together. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Booking Transition. I've acknowledged his buy-in, used his name, and used presumptive language to move into booking.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I'd like to get you in early next week, ideally Monday or Tuesday, so we can start working on those tools to manage your anger and grief while everything from today's session is still fresh. That way, you can begin to feel some relief sooner rather than later.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Timeframe + Specific Rationale. I've suggested a broad timeframe with a specific rationale tied to his most urgent Game Plan point.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Hmm, early next week... I'd have to check my schedule. It's usually pretty packed with school stuff.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is showing hesitation, which is realistic. I'll use the placeholder strategy.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I totally understand, Marcus. Schedules can be hectic. Let's do this: let's just put something in the books since my schedule fills up pretty quickly, and we can always move it if you need to once you check your calendar. That way we at least have something secured and you're not scrambling to find a slot later. Does Monday or Tuesday generally work better for you?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Placeholder Strategy. I've acknowledged his concern and offered a flexible solution to secure a slot.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Tuesday is usually better for me.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has chosen a day.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Perfect! On Tuesday I have eleven AM, two PM, and six PM available. Which time works best for your schedule?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Share Available Slots. I've listed multiple options for the day he chose.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Two PM should work.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has selected a time.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Great – I've got you down as a placeholder for Tuesday at two PM. If you check your schedule and need to adjust it, just shoot me a message and we'll move it around. But at least now we have you locked in and you don't have to worry about my schedule filling up.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Lock in the Booking with Flexibility. I've confirmed the booking confidently, acknowledging the placeholder.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Okay, sounds good.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: Booking is complete. Now I'll transition to Purchase.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Great, I've got you set for Tuesday at two PM. Our final step is to confirm your Coaching Plan.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Purchase Transition. I've smoothly bridged from Booking to Purchase, using \\\\\\"Coaching Plan\\\\\\" terminology.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Based on our conversation today and the Game Plan we've outlined, I recommend our twelve-session Coaching Plan. This plan will give us the dedicated time we need to truly process your grief and anger, rediscover your identity, and build those confident relationship strategies without feeling rushed. It ensures we can go deep enough to create lasting change, rather than just scratching the surface.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Recommend Specific Plan + Rationale. I've recommended one specific plan and tied it directly to his goal and the Future Work plan, explaining why the number of sessions makes sense for his situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>With the twelve-session plan, your hourly rate comes down to one hundred fifty dollars per session, compared to two hundred dollars for a single session. So, you're saving six hundred dollars by committing to your growth with this plan.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Explain Financial Value. I've stated the hourly rate and compared it to the single-session rate, making the savings obvious without leading with the total price.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>This plan also includes installment options to make it more manageable, and you'll have access to text support between sessions for those moments when you need a quick check-in or have a question.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Mention Relevant Perks. I've briefly mentioned relevant perks that support the plan.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>One hundred fifty dollars a session... that's still a lot. I'm not sure I can swing that right now.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is expressing a price concern. I'll handle it by acknowledging and offering one alternative.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I understand that's a significant investment, Marcus.

We can always extend it later if you feel it's right for you.

I've used presumptive language with \\\\\\"Coaching Plan\\\\\\" wording.\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>That concludes the demonstration. I walked through the entire NBG sequence, from Future Work to Booking and Purchase, including handling a client's hesitation during booking and a price concern during purchase.\\\\n\\\\nThis demonstration was Gold Standard because:\\\\n- The Future Work was specific, emotionally resonant, and clearly structured, using \\\\\\"we\\\\\\" language and directly addressing Marcus's unique situation.\\\\n- The Booking process was smooth and presumptive, with a clear rationale for the timing and effective handling of his schedule hesitation using a placeholder.\\\\n- The Purchase recommendation was tailored to his needs, clearly articulated the value and perks, and effectively addressed his price concern by offering a suitable alternative.\\\\n\\\\nReady to try it yourself?

We'll give you tools to manage those intense feelings when they come up, so you can respond thoughtfully instead of reacting impulsively, like what happened with Stephanie.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the first point of the Game Plan. It's the most urgent and directly addresses his recent outburst and suppressed anger, using \\\\\\"we\\\\\\" language and tying it to his specific situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Next, we'll focus on rediscovering your identity outside of your marriage. We'll explore your passions, your values, and what truly makes you, Marcus, tick, so you can build a strong foundation for your new chapter and feel confident in who you are as an individual.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the second point. It's distinct from the first, building on the idea of emotional processing to focus on self-discovery.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>And finally, we'll develop strategies for navigating future relationships and dating. This isn't about rushing into anything, but about equipping you with the confidence and clarity to approach new connections in a way that feels authentic and safe for you, whenever you're ready.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the third point, completing the structured approach and addressing his anxiety about dating, while also respecting his timeline.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>So, we'll start by managing those immediate, intense emotions, then move into rebuilding your sense of self, and finally, prepare you for a confident future in relationships. Each step builds on the last, creating a clear path for you to move forward and build the life you want.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Organizational Structure explanation. I've clearly articulated how the three points are related and work together towards his goal.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That makes a lot of sense. It's... it's a lot to think about, but it sounds like a good plan.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is showing realistic engagement and buy-in after the Future Work.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Marcus, I know how much it means to you to find peace after this divorce, to feel like yourself again, and to build a future that you're genuinely excited about. You deserve to move forward with confidence and clarity, and I truly believe that's achievable for you.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Reiterate Goal Importance part of the Camaraderie Close. I've reflected his specific emotional stakes and why his goal matters to him.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident we can get there together. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Supportive Partnership + Buy-In. I've expressed confidence in him and our partnership, ending with the confident and casual \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Yeah, that sounds really good. I'm ready to... to start feeling better.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has given verbal buy-in. Now I'll transition to Booking.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Wonderful, Marcus – I'm really looking forward to continuing our work together. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Booking Transition. I've acknowledged his buy-in, used his name, and used presumptive language to move into booking.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I'd like to get you in early next week, ideally Monday or Tuesday, so we can start working on those tools to manage your anger and grief while everything from today's session is still fresh. That way, you can begin to feel some relief sooner rather than later.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Timeframe + Specific Rationale. I've suggested a broad timeframe with a specific rationale tied to his most urgent Game Plan point.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Hmm, early next week... I'd have to check my schedule. It's usually pretty packed with school stuff.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is showing hesitation, which is realistic. I'll use the placeholder strategy.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I totally understand, Marcus. Schedules can be hectic. Let's do this: let's just put something in the books since my schedule fills up pretty quickly, and we can always move it if you need to once you check your calendar. That way we at least have something secured and you're not scrambling to find a slot later. Does Monday or Tuesday generally work better for you?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Placeholder Strategy. I've acknowledged his concern and offered a flexible solution to secure a slot.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Tuesday is usually better for me.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has chosen a day.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Perfect! On Tuesday I have eleven AM, two PM, and six PM available. Which time works best for your schedule?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Share Available Slots. I've listed multiple options for the day he chose.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Two PM should work.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has selected a time.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Great – I've got you down as a placeholder for Tuesday at two PM. If you check your schedule and need to adjust it, just shoot me a message and we'll move it around. But at least now we have you locked in and you don't have to worry about my schedule filling up.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Lock in the Booking with Flexibility. I've confirmed the booking confidently, acknowledging the placeholder.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Okay, sounds good.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: Booking is complete. Now I'll transition to Purchase.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Great, I've got you set for Tuesday at two PM. Our final step is to confirm your Coaching Plan.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Purchase Transition. I've smoothly bridged from Booking to Purchase, using \\\\\\"Coaching Plan\\\\\\" terminology.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Based on our conversation today and the Game Plan we've outlined, I recommend our twelve-session Coaching Plan. This plan will give us the dedicated time we need to truly process your grief and anger, rediscover your identity, and build those confident relationship strategies without feeling rushed. It ensures we can go deep enough to create lasting change, rather than just scratching the surface.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Recommend Specific Plan + Rationale. I've recommended one specific plan and tied it directly to his goal and the Future Work plan, explaining why the number of sessions makes sense for his situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>With the twelve-session plan, your hourly rate comes down to one hundred fifty dollars per session, compared to two hundred dollars for a single session. So, you're saving six hundred dollars by committing to your growth with this plan.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Explain Financial Value. I've stated the hourly rate and compared it to the single-session rate, making the savings obvious without leading with the total price.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>This plan also includes installment options to make it more manageable, and you'll have access to text support between sessions for those moments when you need a quick check-in or have a question.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Mention Relevant Perks. I've briefly mentioned relevant perks that support the plan.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>One hundred fifty dollars a session... that's still a lot. I'm not sure I can swing that right now.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is expressing a price concern. I'll handle it by acknowledging and offering one alternative.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I understand that's a significant investment, Marcus. Your growth and well-being are absolutely worth it, and I want to make sure coaching is accessible for you. We could start with a six-session plan, which would still give us a solid foundation to begin processing your emotions and rediscovering your identity. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Handling Price Concern. I've acknowledged his concern and offered one alternative (a smaller plan) with a clear rationale, ending with \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\" and pausing.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>A six-session plan... that might be more doable. What would that look like?</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is open to the alternative.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>With the six-session plan, your hourly rate would be one hundred seventy-five dollars per session, and we could focus on those first two points of our Game Plan: processing your anger and grief, and starting to rediscover your identity. We can always extend it later if you feel it's right for you. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: I've provided details...\\",\\"multivoice_message\\":{\\"parts\\":[{\\"text\\":\\"I'll now demonstrate a full NBG conversation with this client.

I've acknowledged his emotions and validated them, connecting them directly to his situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Ultimately, what you're looking for is to navigate this divorce with more peace, rediscover your sense of self, and build a fulfilling future, whatever that looks like.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Goal Reflection. I've named his specific goal and the underlying motivation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Here's what our work together will look like going forward.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Transition to Game Plan. I'm using confident, presumptive language to guide him into the next phase.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>First, we're going to work on processing that anger and grief in a healthy way, so you can release some of that heavy emotional burden and stop feeling like you have to suppress everything. We'll give you tools to manage those intense feelings when they come up, so you can respond thoughtfully instead of reacting impulsively, like what happened with Stephanie.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the first point of the Game Plan. It's the most urgent and directly addresses his recent outburst and suppressed anger, using \\\\\\"we\\\\\\" language and tying it to his specific situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Next, we'll focus on rediscovering your identity outside of your marriage. We'll explore your passions, your values, and what truly makes you, Marcus, tick, so you can build a strong foundation for your new chapter and feel confident in who you are as an individual.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the second point. It's distinct from the first, building on the idea of emotional processing to focus on self-discovery.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>And finally, we'll develop strategies for navigating future relationships and dating. This isn't about rushing into anything, but about equipping you with the confidence and clarity to approach new connections in a way that feels authentic and safe for you, whenever you're ready.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the third point, completing the structured approach and addressing his anxiety about dating, while also respecting his timeline.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>So, we'll start by managing those immediate, intense emotions, then move into rebuilding your sense of self, and finally, prepare you for a confident future in relationships. Each step builds on the last, creating a clear path for you to move forward and build the life you want.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Organizational Structure explanation. I've clearly articulated how the three points are related and work together towards his goal.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That makes a lot of sense. It's... it's a lot to think about, but it sounds like a good plan.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is showing realistic engagement and buy-in after the Future Work.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Marcus, I know how much it means to you to find peace after this divorce, to feel like yourself again, and to build a future that you're genuinely excited about. You deserve to move forward with confidence and clarity, and I truly believe that's achievable for you.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Reiterate Goal Importance part of the Camaraderie Close. I've reflected his specific emotional stakes and why his goal matters to him.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident we can get there together. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Supportive Partnership + Buy-In. I've expressed confidence in him and our partnership, ending with the confident and casual \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Yeah, that sounds really good. I'm ready to... to start feeling better.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has given verbal buy-in. Now I'll transition to Booking.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Wonderful, Marcus – I'm really looking forward to continuing our work together. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Booking Transition. I've acknowledged his buy-in, used his name, and used presumptive language to move into booking.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I'd like to get you in early next week, ideally Monday or Tuesday, so we can start working on those tools to manage your anger and grief while everything from today's session is still fresh. That way, you can begin to feel some relief sooner rather than later.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Timeframe + Specific Rationale. I've suggested a broad timeframe with a specific rationale tied to his most urgent Game Plan point.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Hmm, early next week... I'd have to check my schedule. It's usually pretty packed with school stuff.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is showing hesitation, which is realistic. I'll use the placeholder strategy.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I totally understand, Marcus. Schedules can be hectic. Let's do this: let's just put something in the books since my schedule fills up pretty quickly, and we can always move it if you need to once you check your calendar. That way we at least have something secured and you're not scrambling to find a slot later. Does Monday or Tuesday generally work better for you?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Placeholder Strategy. I've acknowledged his concern and offered a flexible solution to secure a slot.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Tuesday is usually better for me.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has chosen a day.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Perfect! On Tuesday I have eleven AM, two PM, and six PM available. Which time works best for your schedule?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Share Available Slots. I've listed multiple options for the day he chose.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Two PM should work.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has selected a time.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Great – I've got you down as a placeholder for Tuesday at two PM. If you check your schedule and need to adjust it, just shoot me a message and we'll move it around. But at least now we have you locked in and you don't have to worry about my schedule filling up.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Lock in the Booking with Flexibility. I've confirmed the booking confidently, acknowledging the placeholder.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Okay, sounds good.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: Booking is complete. Now I'll transition to Purchase.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Great, I've got you set for Tuesday at two PM. Our final step is to confirm your Coaching Plan.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Purchase Transition. I've smoothly bridged from Booking to Purchase, using \\\\\\"Coaching Plan\\\\\\" terminology.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Based on our conversation today and the Game Plan we've outlined, I recommend our twelve-session Coaching Plan. This plan will give us the dedicated time we need to truly process your grief and anger, rediscover your identity, and build those confident relationship strategies without feeling rushed. It ensures we can go deep enough to create lasting change, rather than just scratching the surface.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Recommend Specific Plan + Rationale. I've recommended one specific plan and tied it directly to his goal and the Future Work plan, explaining why the number of sessions makes sense for his situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>With the twelve-session plan, your hourly rate comes down to one hundred fifty dollars per session, compared to two hundred dollars for a single session. So, you're saving six hundred dollars by committing to your growth with this plan.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Explain Financial Value. I've stated the hourly rate and compared it to the single-session rate, making the savings obvious without leading with the total price.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>This plan also includes installment options to make it more manageable, and you'll have access to text support between sessions for those moments when you need a quick check-in or have a question.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Mention Relevant Perks. I've briefly mentioned relevant perks that support the plan.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>One hundred fifty dollars a session... that's still a lot. I'm not sure I can swing that right now.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is expressing a price concern. I'll handle it by acknowledging and offering one alternative.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I understand that's a significant investment, Marcus. Your growth and well-being are absolutely worth it, and I want to make sure coaching is accessible for you. We could start with a six-session plan, which would still give us a solid foundation to begin processing your emotions and rediscovering your identity. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Handling Price Concern. I've acknowledged his concern and offered one alternative (a smaller plan) with a clear rationale, ending with \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\" and pausing.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>A six-session plan... that might be more doable. What would that look like?</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is open to the alternative.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>With the six-session plan, your hourly rate would be one hundred seventy-five dollars per session, and we could focus on those first two points of our Game Plan: processing your anger and grief, and starting to rediscover your identity. We can always extend it later if you feel it's right for you. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: I've provided details for the alternative plan and tied it back to the Game Plan.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Okay, yeah, that sounds better. I think I can do that.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has confirmed.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Perfect – I'll go ahead and process your six-session Coaching Plan now.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Confident Close. I've used presumptive language with \\\\\\"Coaching Plan\\\\\\" wording.\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>That concludes the demonstration. I walked through the entire NBG sequence, from Future Work to Booking and Purchase, including handling a client's hesitation during booking and a price concern during purchase.\\\\n\\\\nThis demonstration was Gold Standard because:\\\\n- The Future Work was specific, emotionally resonant, and clearly structured, using \\\\\\"we\\\\\\" language and directly addressing Marcus's unique situation.\\\\n- The Booking process was smooth and presumptive, with a clear rationale for the timing and effective handling of his schedule hesitation using a placeholder.\\\\n- The Purchase recommendation was tailored to his needs, clearly articulated the value and perks, and effectively addressed his price concern by offering a suitable alternative.\\\\n\\\\nReady to try it yourself?

Riley told Marcus about Stephanie's boyfriend. Marcus handled it poorly - snapped at Stephanie over text for the first time expressing anger.

But I think I needed to hear it.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the client's natural closing-of-session line, based on his emotional state. I'm now entering the role of the coach to demonstrate the NBG.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Marcus, I know today was a tough session, and we really dug into some painful stuff. We talked about the shock and hurt you felt when Riley told you about Stephanie's new boyfriend, and how that led to you lashing out, which isn't like you. It's clear you're grieving the end of your fifteen-year marriage, and there's a lot of anger and confusion mixed in with that. You're feeling lost about who you are now, and anxious about what comes next, especially with dating. But we also uncovered that beneath all of that, there's a part of you that's ready to move forward and redefine your identity.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Summary and Analysis part of the Opening. I've summarized what Marcus shared, included an analysis of his emotional state, and highlighted his readiness for change, all using his specific context.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load right now, Marcus. That anger, the loneliness, the uncertainty – it's all very real and understandable given everything you've been through. It's okay to feel all of that, and it makes perfect sense why you'd be struggling with these emotions.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Feelings Reflection. I've acknowledged his emotions and validated them, connecting them directly to his situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Ultimately, what you're looking for is to navigate this divorce with more peace, rediscover your sense of self, and build a fulfilling future, whatever that looks like.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Goal Reflection. I've named his specific goal and the underlying motivation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Here's what our work together will look like going forward.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Transition to Game Plan. I'm using confident, presumptive language to guide him into the next phase.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>First, we're going to work on processing that anger and grief in a healthy way, so you can release some of that heavy emotional burden and stop feeling like you have to suppress everything. We'll give you tools to manage those intense feelings when they come up, so you can respond thoughtfully instead of reacting impulsively, like what happened with Stephanie.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the first point of the Game Plan. It's the most urgent and directly addresses his recent outburst and suppressed anger, using \\\\\\"we\\\\\\" language and tying it to his specific situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Next, we'll focus on rediscovering your identity outside of your marriage. We'll explore your passions, your values, and what truly makes you, Marcus, tick, so you can build a strong foundation for your new chapter and feel confident in who you are as an individual.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the second point. It's distinct from the first, building on the idea of emotional processing to focus on self-discovery.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>And finally, we'll develop strategies for navigating future relationships and dating. This isn't about rushing into anything, but about equipping you with the confidence and clarity to approach new connections in a way that feels authentic and safe for you, whenever you're ready.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the third point, completing the structured approach and addressing his anxiety about dating, while also respecting his timeline.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>So, we'll start by managing those immediate, intense emotions, then move into rebuilding your sense of self, and finally, prepare you for a confident future in relationships. Each step builds on the last, creating a clear path for you to move forward and build the life you want.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Organizational Structure explanation. I've clearly articulated how the three points are related and work together towards his goal.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That makes a lot of sense. It's... it's a lot to think about, but it sounds like a good plan.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is showing realistic engagement and buy-in after the Future Work.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Marcus, I know how much it means to you to find peace after this divorce, to feel like yourself again, and to build a future that you're genuinely excited about. You deserve to move forward with confidence and clarity, and I truly believe that's achievable for you.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Reiterate Goal Importance part of the Camaraderie Close. I've reflected his specific emotional stakes and why his goal matters to him.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident we can get there together. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Supportive Partnership + Buy-In. I've expressed confidence in him and our partnership, ending with the confident and casual \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Yeah, that sounds really good. I'm ready to... to start feeling better.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has given verbal buy-in. Now I'll transition to Booking.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Wonderful, Marcus – I'm really looking forward to continuing our work together. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Booking Transition. I've acknowledged his buy-in, used his name, and used presumptive language to move into booking.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I'd like to get you in early next week, ideally Monday or Tuesday, so we can start working on those tools to manage your anger and grief while everything from today's session is still fresh. That way, you can begin to feel some relief sooner rather than later.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Timeframe + Specific Rationale. I've suggested a broad timeframe with a specific rationale tied to his most urgent Game Plan point.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Hmm, early next week... I'd have to check my schedule. It's usually pretty packed with school stuff.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is showing hesitation, which is realistic. I'll use the placeholder strategy.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I totally understand, Marcus. Schedules can be hectic. Let's do this: let's just put something in the books since my schedule fills up pretty quickly, and we can always move it if you need to once you check your calendar. That way we at least have something secured and you're not scrambling to find a slot later. Does Monday or Tuesday generally work better for you?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Placeholder Strategy. I've acknowledged his concern and offered a flexible solution to secure a slot.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Tuesday is usually better for me.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has chosen a day.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Perfect! On Tuesday I have eleven AM, two PM, and six PM available. Which time works best for your schedule?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Share Available Slots. I've listed multiple options for the day he chose.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Two PM should work.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has selected a time.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Great – I've got you down as a placeholder for Tuesday at two PM. If you check your schedule and need to adjust it, just shoot me a message and we'll move it around. But at least now we have you locked in and you don't have to worry about my schedule filling up.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Lock in the Booking with Flexibility. I've confirmed the booking confidently, acknowledging the placeholder.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Okay, sounds good.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: Booking is complete. Now I'll transition to Purchase.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Great, I've got you set for Tuesday at two PM. Our final step is to confirm your Coaching Plan.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Purchase Transition. I've smoothly bridged from Booking to Purchase, using \\\\\\"Coaching Plan\\\\\\" terminology.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Based on our conversation today and the Game Plan we've outlined, I recommend our twelve-session Coaching Plan. This plan will give us the dedicated time we need to truly process your grief and anger, rediscover your identity, and build those confident relationship strategies without feeling rushed. It ensures we can go deep enough to create lasting change, rather than just scratching the surface.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Recommend Specific Plan + Rationale. I've recommended one specific plan and tied it directly to his goal and the Future Work plan, explaining why the number of sessions makes sense for his situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>With the twelve-session plan, your hourly rate comes down to one hundred fifty dollars per session, compared to two hundred dollars for a single session. So, you're saving six hundred dollars by committing to your growth with this plan.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Explain Financial Value. I've stated the hourly rate and compared it to the single-session rate, making the savings obvious without leading with the total price.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>This plan also includes installment options to make it more manageable, and you'll have access to text support between sessions for those moments when you need a quick check-in or have a question.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Mention Relevant Perks. I've briefly mentioned relevant perks that support the plan.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>One hundred fifty dollars a session... that's still a lot. I'm not sure I can swing that right now.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is expressing a price concern. I'll handle it by acknowledging and offering one alternative.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I understand that's a significant investment, Marcus. Your growth and well-being are absolutely worth it, and I want to make sure coaching is accessible for you. We could start with a six-session plan, which would still give us a solid foundation to begin processing your emotions and rediscovering your identity. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Handling Price Concern. I've acknowledged his concern and offered one alternative (a smaller plan) with a clear rationale, ending with \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\" and pausing.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>A six-session plan... that might be more doable. What would that look like?</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is open to the alternative.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>With the six-session plan, your hourly rate would be one hundred seventy-five dollars per session, and we could focus on those first two points of our Game Plan: processing your anger and grief, and starting to rediscover your identity. We can always extend it later if you feel it's right for you.

Each step builds on the last, creating a clear path for you to move forward and build the life you want.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Organizational Structure explanation. I've clearly articulated how the three points are related and work together towards his goal.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That makes a lot of sense. It's... it's a lot to think about, but it sounds like a good plan.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is showing realistic engagement and buy-in after the Future Work.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Marcus, I know how much it means to you to find peace after this divorce, to feel like yourself again, and to build a future that you're genuinely excited about. You deserve to move forward with confidence and clarity, and I truly believe that's achievable for you.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Reiterate Goal Importance part of the Camaraderie Close. I've reflected his specific emotional stakes and why his goal matters to him.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident we can get there together. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Supportive Partnership + Buy-In. I've expressed confidence in him and our partnership, ending with the confident and casual \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Yeah, that sounds really good. I'm ready to... to start feeling better.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has given verbal buy-in. Now I'll transition to Booking.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Wonderful, Marcus – I'm really looking forward to continuing our work together. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Booking Transition. I've acknowledged his buy-in, used his name, and used presumptive language to move into booking.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I'd like to get you in early next week, ideally Monday or Tuesday, so we can start working on those tools to manage your anger and grief while everything from today's session is still fresh. That way, you can begin to feel some relief sooner rather than later.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Timeframe + Specific Rationale. I've suggested a broad timeframe with a specific rationale tied to his most urgent Game Plan point.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Hmm, early next week... I'd have to check my schedule. It's usually pretty packed with school stuff.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is showing hesitation, which is realistic. I'll use the placeholder strategy.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I totally understand, Marcus. Schedules can be hectic. Let's do this: let's just put something in the books since my schedule fills up pretty quickly, and we can always move it if you need to once you check your calendar. That way we at least have something secured and you're not scrambling to find a slot later. Does Monday or Tuesday generally work better for you?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Placeholder Strategy. I've acknowledged his concern and offered a flexible solution to secure a slot.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Tuesday is usually better for me.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has chosen a day.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Perfect! On Tuesday I have eleven AM, two PM, and six PM available. Which time works best for your schedule?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Share Available Slots. I've listed multiple options for the day he chose.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Two PM should work.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has selected a time.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Great – I've got you down as a placeholder for Tuesday at two PM. If you check your schedule and need to adjust it, just shoot me a message and we'll move it around. But at least now we have you locked in and you don't have to worry about my schedule filling up.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Lock in the Booking with Flexibility. I've confirmed the booking confidently, acknowledging the placeholder.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Okay, sounds good.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: Booking is complete. Now I'll transition to Purchase.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Great, I've got you set for Tuesday at two PM. Our final step is to confirm your Coaching Plan.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Purchase Transition. I've smoothly bridged from Booking to Purchase, using \\\\\\"Coaching Plan\\\\\\" terminology.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Based on our conversation today and the Game Plan we've outlined, I recommend our twelve-session Coaching Plan. This plan will give us the dedicated time we need to truly process your grief and anger, rediscover your identity, and build those confident relationship strategies without feeling rushed. It ensures we can go deep enough to create lasting change, rather than just scratching the surface.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Recommend Specific Plan + Rationale. I've recommended one specific plan and tied it directly to his goal and the Future Work plan, explaining why the number of sessions makes sense for his situation.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>With the twelve-session plan, your hourly rate comes down to one hundred fifty dollars per session, compared to two hundred dollars for a single session. So, you're saving six hundred dollars by committing to your growth with this plan.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Explain Financial Value. I've stated the hourly rate and compared it to the single-session rate, making the savings obvious without leading with the total price.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>This plan also includes installment options to make it more manageable, and you'll have access to text support between sessions for those moments when you need a quick check-in or have a question.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Mention Relevant Perks. I've briefly mentioned relevant perks that support the plan.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>One hundred fifty dollars a session... that's still a lot. I'm not sure I can swing that right now.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is expressing a price concern. I'll handle it by acknowledging and offering one alternative.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>I understand that's a significant investment, Marcus. Your growth and well-being are absolutely worth it, and I want to make sure coaching is accessible for you. We could start with a six-session plan, which would still give us a solid foundation to begin processing your emotions and rediscovering your identity. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is Handling Price Concern. I've acknowledged his concern and offered one alternative (a smaller plan) with a clear rationale, ending with \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\" and pausing.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>A six-session plan... that might be more doable. What would that look like?</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client is open to the alternative.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>With the six-session plan, your hourly rate would be one hundred seventy-five dollars per session, and we could focus on those first two points of our Game Plan: processing your anger and grief, and starting to rediscover your identity. We can always extend it later if you feel it's right for you. How does that sound?</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: I've provided details for the alternative plan and tied it back to the Game Plan.\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Okay, yeah, that sounds better. I think I can do that.</Eric>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client has confirmed.\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>Perfect – I'll go ahead and process your six-session Coaching Plan now.</Natasha>\\\\n⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is the Confident Close. I've used presumptive language with \\\\\\"Coaching Plan\\\\\\" wording.\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>That concludes the demonstration. I walked through the entire NBG sequence, from Future Work to Booking and Purchase, including handling a client's hesitation during booking and a price concern during purchase.\\\\n\\\\nThis demonstration was Gold Standard because:\\\\n- The Future Work was specific, emotionally resonant, and clearly structured, using \\\\\\"we\\\\\\" language and directly addressing Marcus's unique situation.\\\\n- The Booking process was smooth and presumptive, with a clear rationale for the timing and effective handling of his schedule hesitation using a placeholder.\\\\n- The Purchase recommendation was tailored to his needs, clearly articulated the value and perks, and effectively addressed his price concern by offering a suitable alternative.\\\\n\\\\nReady to try it yourself?

I'll alternate between:\\\\n\\\\n- Coach dialogue (me as the coach),\\\\n- Client responses (me as the client),\\\\n- Mentor commentary explaining what’s happening and why.\\\\n\\\\nI'll be playing a client named Marcus Johnson, a forty-two-year-old high school history teacher. He's grieving the end of a fifteen-year marriage, angry but trying to suppress it, lonely, and anxious about dating again. He recently snapped at his ex-wife, Stephanie, over text, which prompted him to seek coaching.\\\\n\\\\nLet's begin!</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>First, I'll start with the coach's opening for Future Work.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Marcus, we covered a lot today, and it sounds like you're really grappling with the end of your marriage to Stephanie. You're feeling a mix of anger and sadness, especially after that text exchange, and you're realizing that you need to find a way to move forward and redefine who you are outside of that relationship. It's a tough spot to be in, but you've taken a huge step by being here.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This opening is strong because it summarizes what the client shared, includes an analysis of his emotional state, and uses his specific language and situation. It sets the stage for the next steps.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>I can hear how much pain and frustration you're carrying, Marcus. It's clear that the anger you felt, even though you tried to suppress it, came from a place of deep hurt and a sense of betrayal, especially with Riley's involvement. And that feeling of being told to \\\\\\"move on\\\\\\" by Stephanie, after everything you've been through, must have been incredibly jarring and painful.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This feelings reflection is excellent. It acknowledges Marcus's emotions, connects them to specific events and people he mentioned (Riley, Stephanie's text), and goes beyond generic statements to truly reflect his emotional reality.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Ultimately, Marcus, what you're looking for is to heal from this divorce, regain your sense of self, and confidently navigate the idea of dating again, so you can build a fulfilling future that's truly yours.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This goal reflection is concise and specific. It clearly names Marcus's goal and explains why it matters to him, tying it back to his desire for a fulfilling future and a renewed sense of self.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Here's what our work together will look like going forward.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This transition is perfect. It uses confident, presumptive language, avoiding any tentative phrasing, and smoothly moves into the Game Plan.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That makes sense. It's a lot to take in, but I appreciate you laying it out like that. It does feel like I'm at a crossroads.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client's response shows engagement and buy-in, even with a touch of his characteristic processing. Now, I'll demonstrate the Game Plan.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>First, we're going to work on processing that anger and grief in a healthy way, Marcus. We'll explore those feelings around the divorce and the recent text exchange, so you can understand them without feeling like you have to suppress them. This will help you release some of that emotional weight you've been carrying.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This first point is urgent and specific. It addresses Marcus's immediate emotional struggle with anger and grief, uses \\\\\\"we\\\\\\" language, and directly ties to his goal of healing.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Then, once we've created a healthier space for those emotions, we'll focus on rediscovering your identity outside of the marriage. We'll explore your passions, your values, and what truly makes you, Marcus, so you can rebuild your confidence and feel secure in who you are as an individual.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This second point is distinct from the first and builds upon it. It shows a clear progression from emotional processing to identity rediscovery, adding unique value to the plan.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>And finally, we'll equip you with strategies to confidently approach dating again. We'll work on setting healthy boundaries and communicating your needs effectively, so you can navigate new relationships with clarity and avoid repeating past patterns, ultimately leading you to a fulfilling connection.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This third point completes the structured approach, offering a clear path towards his goal of confidently dating again. All three points are distinct and tied to his overall objective.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>So, to put it simply, we'll start by addressing the immediate emotional weight, then move into rebuilding your personal foundation, and finally, prepare you for a confident and healthy future in relationships. Each step builds on the last to get you to that place of peace and self-assurance you're looking for.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This explanation of the organizational structure is clear and coherent. It explicitly shows how the three points relate to each other and work together towards Marcus's goal, making the plan feel cohesive.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That sounds... comprehensive. I can see how those steps connect. It's a bit daunting, but I also feel a sense of relief knowing there's a path forward.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus's response shows realistic engagement. He acknowledges the plan's scope and expresses both apprehension and relief, indicating buy-in. Now, I'll demonstrate the Camaraderie Close.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Marcus, I know how important it is for you to move past this pain and build a future where you feel confident and genuinely happy, where you're not constantly second-guessing yourself or feeling that sting of betrayal. You deserve to feel secure and excited about what's next, and that's absolutely what we're going to achieve together.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This reiterates the goal's importance with deep understanding. It uses Marcus's specific emotional stakes and language, making him feel truly seen and understood.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident we can get you to that place of peace and self-assurance. How does that sound?</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This supportive partnership statement is warm and presumptive. It expresses confidence in Marcus and the coaching relationship, ending with the critical \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\" to invite confirmation without debate.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Yeah, that sounds really good. I'm ready to do the work.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus's verbal buy-in is clear. Future Work is now complete. Next, I'll demonstrate the Booking process.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Wonderful, Marcus – I'm really looking forward to continuing our work together. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This transition is smooth and warm. It acknowledges Marcus's buy-in, uses his name, and employs presumptive language to move directly into booking, maintaining momentum.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>I'd like to get you in early next week – ideally Monday or Tuesday – so we can start processing those immediate feelings around the text exchange while everything is still fresh. That way, we can begin to unpack that anger and hurt before it has a chance to fester.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This timeframe recommendation is clear and specific. It suggests a broad timeframe (early next week) with a strong rationale directly tied to Marcus's urgent emotional state and the first point of the Game Plan.</Natasha\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Which of those days works best for you?</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is a direct and clear question, consistent with the recommended timeframe, allowing Marcus to choose a day.</Natasha\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Hmm, Tuesday is usually better for me.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus has chosen a day. Now, I'll demonstrate sharing available slots.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Great! On Tuesday, I have 10 AM, 1 PM, and 4 PM available. Which time works best for your schedule?</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This provides multiple concrete time options for the chosen day, making it easy for Marcus to select a slot.</Natasha\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>1 PM works well.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus has selected a time. Now, I'll demonstrate locking in the booking.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Excellent – I've got you locked in for Tuesday at 1 PM. Looking forward to it!</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is a confident confirmation, specifying the day and time, leaving no room for ambiguity. Booking is complete.

I'll alternate between:\\\\n\\\\n- Coach dialogue (me as the coach),\\\\n- Client responses (me as the client),\\\\n- Mentor commentary explaining what’s happening and why.\\\\n\\\\nI'll be playing a client named Marcus Johnson, a forty-two-year-old high school history teacher. He's grieving the end of a fifteen-year marriage, angry but trying to suppress it, lonely, and anxious about dating again. He recently snapped at his ex-wife, Stephanie, over text, which prompted him to seek coaching.\\\\n\\\\nLet's begin!</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>First, I'll start with the coach's opening for Future Work.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Marcus, we covered a lot today, and it sounds like you're really grappling with the end of your marriage to Stephanie. You're feeling a mix of anger and sadness, especially after that text exchange, and you're realizing that you need to find a way to move forward and redefine who you are outside of that relationship. It's a tough spot to be in, but you've taken a huge step by being here.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This opening is strong because it summarizes what the client shared, includes an analysis of his emotional state, and uses his specific language and situation. It sets the stage for the next steps.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>I can hear how much pain and frustration you're carrying, Marcus. It's clear that the anger you felt, even though you tried to suppress it, came from a place of deep hurt and a sense of betrayal, especially with Riley's involvement. And that feeling of being told to \\\\\\"move on\\\\\\" by Stephanie, after everything you've been through, must have been incredibly jarring and painful.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This feelings reflection is excellent. It acknowledges Marcus's emotions, connects them to specific events and people he mentioned (Riley, Stephanie's text), and goes beyond generic statements to truly reflect his emotional reality.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Ultimately, Marcus, what you're looking for is to heal from this divorce, regain your sense of self, and confidently navigate the idea of dating again, so you can build a fulfilling future that's truly yours.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This goal reflection is concise and specific. It clearly names Marcus's goal and explains why it matters to him, tying it back to his desire for a fulfilling future and a renewed sense of self.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Here's what our work together will look like going forward.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This transition is perfect. It uses confident, presumptive language, avoiding any tentative phrasing, and smoothly moves into the Game Plan.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That makes sense. It's a lot to take in, but I appreciate you laying it out like that. It does feel like I'm at a crossroads.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client's response shows engagement and buy-in, even with a touch of his characteristic processing. Now, I'll demonstrate the Game Plan.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>First, we're going to work on processing that anger and grief in a healthy way, Marcus. We'll explore those feelings around the divorce and the recent text exchange, so you can understand them without feeling like you have to suppress them. This will help you release some of that emotional weight you've been carrying.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This first point is urgent and specific. It addresses Marcus's immediate emotional struggle with anger and grief, uses \\\\\\"we\\\\\\" language, and directly ties to his goal of healing.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Then, once we've created a healthier space for those emotions, we'll focus on rediscovering your identity outside of the marriage. We'll explore your passions, your values, and what truly makes you, Marcus, so you can rebuild your confidence and feel secure in who you are as an individual.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This second point is distinct from the first and builds upon it. It shows a clear progression from emotional processing to identity rediscovery, adding unique value to the plan.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>And finally, we'll equip you with strategies to confidently approach dating again. We'll work on setting healthy boundaries and communicating your needs effectively, so you can navigate new relationships with clarity and avoid repeating past patterns, ultimately leading you to a fulfilling connection.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This third point completes the structured approach, offering a clear path towards his goal of confidently dating again. All three points are distinct and tied to his overall objective.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>So, to put it simply, we'll start by addressing the immediate emotional weight, then move into rebuilding your personal foundation, and finally, prepare you for a confident and healthy future in relationships. Each step builds on the last to get you to that place of peace and self-assurance you're looking for.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This explanation of the organizational structure is clear and coherent. It explicitly shows how the three points relate to each other and work together towards Marcus's goal, making the plan feel cohesive.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That sounds... comprehensive. I can see how those steps connect. It's a bit daunting, but I also feel a sense of relief knowing there's a path forward.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus's response shows realistic engagement. He acknowledges the plan's scope and expresses both apprehension and relief, indicating buy-in. Now, I'll demonstrate the Camaraderie Close.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Marcus, I know how important it is for you to move past this pain and build a future where you feel confident and genuinely happy, where you're not constantly second-guessing yourself or feeling that sting of betrayal. You deserve to feel secure and excited about what's next, and that's absolutely what we're going to achieve together.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This reiterates the goal's importance with deep understanding. It uses Marcus's specific emotional stakes and language, making him feel truly seen and understood.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident we can get you to that place of peace and self-assurance. How does that sound?</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This supportive partnership statement is warm and presumptive. It expresses confidence in Marcus and the coaching relationship, ending with the critical \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\" to invite confirmation without debate.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Yeah, that sounds really good. I'm ready to do the work.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus's verbal buy-in is clear. Future Work is now complete. Next, I'll demonstrate the Booking process.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Wonderful, Marcus – I'm really looking forward to continuing our work together. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This transition is smooth and warm. It acknowledges Marcus's buy-in, uses his name, and employs presumptive language to move directly into booking, maintaining momentum.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>I'd like to get you in early next week – ideally Monday or Tuesday – so we can start processing those immediate feelings around the text exchange while everything is still fresh. That way, we can begin to unpack that anger and hurt before it has a chance to fester.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This timeframe recommendation is clear and specific. It suggests a broad timeframe (early next week) with a strong rationale directly tied to Marcus's urgent emotional state and the first point of the Game Plan.</Natasha\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Which of those days works best for you?</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is a direct and clear question, consistent with the recommended timeframe, allowing Marcus to choose a day.</Natasha\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Hmm, Tuesday is usually better for me.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus has chosen a day. Now, I'll demonstrate sharing available slots.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Great! On Tuesday, I have 10 AM, 1 PM, and 4 PM available. Which time works best for your schedule?</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This provides multiple concrete time options for the chosen day, making it easy for Marcus to select a slot.</Natasha\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>1 PM works well.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus has selected a time. Now, I'll demonstrate locking in the booking.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Excellent – I've got you locked in for Tuesday at 1 PM. Looking forward to it!</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is a confident confirmation, specifying the day and time, leaving no room for ambiguity. Booking is complete. Now, I'll demonstrate the Purchase process.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Great, I’ve got you set for Tuesday at 1 PM. Our final step is to confirm your Coaching Plan.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This transition is smooth and uses the correct \\\\\\"Coaching Plan\\\\\\" terminology, bridging seamlessly from booking to purchase with a presumptive tone.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Based on our conversation and the three-point Game Plan we discussed, I recommend our twelve-session Coaching Plan. This plan will give us the dedicated time to thoroughly process your grief and anger, deeply explore your identity outside of your marriage, and then build those confident dating strategies. It ensures we have the space to address each step comprehensively, rather than rushing through such significant life changes.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This recommends one specific plan (the largest, as appropriate here) and ties it directly to Marcus's goal and the Future Work plan. It explains why the number of sessions makes sense for his situation, using \\\\\\"we\\\\\\" language and specific client details.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>The twelve-session plan breaks down to one hundred fifty dollars per session, compared to two hundred dollars for a single session. So, you're saving six hundred dollars by committing to the full plan, which really allows for that deeper, more impactful work.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This clearly explains the financial value by stating the hourly rate, comparing it to the single-session rate, and making the savings obvious without leading with the total price.</Natasha\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Additionally, this plan includes text support between sessions for those moments when you need a quick check-in, and access to our online journal tools to help you track your progress and insights.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This briefly mentions relevant perks that support the plan, keeping it concise and not presenting them as the core reason for purchase.</Natasha\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That sounds like a good plan. I'm ready to move forward.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus has confirmed. Now, I'll demonstrate the confident close.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Perfect – I’ll go ahead and process your Coaching Plan now.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is a confident and presumptive close, using \\\\\\"Coaching Plan\\\\\\" terminology and executing smoothly.\\\\n\\\\nThat concludes the demonstration!\\\\n\\\\nHere's a brief summary of what made this a Gold Standard demonstration:\\\\n\\\\nThe Future Work was excellent, with a clear summary and analysis, specific feelings and goal reflections, and a confident transition. The Game Plan was well-structured with three distinct, urgent, and collaborative points, and the Camaraderie Close effectively reiterated the goal's importance and secured buy-in. Booking was handled smoothly with a clear timeframe, specific rationale, and efficient slot selection. Finally, the Purchase process recommended a specific plan tied to the client's needs, clearly explained the value and perks, and closed confidently.\\\\n\\\\nReady to try it yourself?

I'll alternate between:\\\\n\\\\n- Coach dialogue (me as the coach),\\\\n- Client responses (me as the client),\\\\n- Mentor commentary explaining what’s happening and why.\\\\n\\\\nI'll be playing a client named Marcus Johnson, a forty-two-year-old high school history teacher. He's grieving the end of a fifteen-year marriage, angry but trying to suppress it, lonely, and anxious about dating again. He recently snapped at his ex-wife, Stephanie, over text, which prompted him to seek coaching.\\\\n\\\\nLet's begin!</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>First, I'll start with the coach's opening for Future Work.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Marcus, we covered a lot today, and it sounds like you're really grappling with the end of your marriage to Stephanie. You're feeling a mix of anger and sadness, especially after that text exchange, and you're realizing that you need to find a way to move forward and redefine who you are outside of that relationship. It's a tough spot to be in, but you've taken a huge step by being here.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This opening is strong because it summarizes what the client shared, includes an analysis of his emotional state, and uses his specific language and situation. It sets the stage for the next steps.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>I can hear how much pain and frustration you're carrying, Marcus. It's clear that the anger you felt, even though you tried to suppress it, came from a place of deep hurt and a sense of betrayal, especially with Riley's involvement. And that feeling of being told to \\\\\\"move on\\\\\\" by Stephanie, after everything you've been through, must have been incredibly jarring and painful.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This feelings reflection is excellent. It acknowledges Marcus's emotions, connects them to specific events and people he mentioned (Riley, Stephanie's text), and goes beyond generic statements to truly reflect his emotional reality.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Ultimately, Marcus, what you're looking for is to heal from this divorce, regain your sense of self, and confidently navigate the idea of dating again, so you can build a fulfilling future that's truly yours.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This goal reflection is concise and specific. It clearly names Marcus's goal and explains why it matters to him, tying it back to his desire for a fulfilling future and a renewed sense of self.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Here's what our work together will look like going forward.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This transition is perfect. It uses confident, presumptive language, avoiding any tentative phrasing, and smoothly moves into the Game Plan.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That makes sense. It's a lot to take in, but I appreciate you laying it out like that. It does feel like I'm at a crossroads.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client's response shows engagement and buy-in, even with a touch of his characteristic processing. Now, I'll demonstrate the Game Plan.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>First, we're going to work on processing that anger and grief in a healthy way, Marcus. We'll explore those feelings around the divorce and the recent text exchange, so you can understand them without feeling like you have to suppress them. This will help you release some of that emotional weight you've been carrying.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This first point is urgent and specific. It addresses Marcus's immediate emotional struggle with anger and grief, uses \\\\\\"we\\\\\\" language, and directly ties to his goal of healing.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Then, once we've created a healthier space for those emotions, we'll focus on rediscovering your identity outside of the marriage. We'll explore your passions, your values, and what truly makes you, Marcus, so you can rebuild your confidence and feel secure in who you are as an individual.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This second point is distinct from the first and builds upon it. It shows a clear progression from emotional processing to identity rediscovery, adding unique value to the plan.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>And finally, we'll equip you with strategies to confidently approach dating again. We'll work on setting healthy boundaries and communicating your needs effectively, so you can navigate new relationships with clarity and avoid repeating past patterns, ultimately leading you to a fulfilling connection.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This third point completes the structured approach, offering a clear path towards his goal of confidently dating again. All three points are distinct and tied to his overall objective.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>So, to put it simply, we'll start by addressing the immediate emotional weight, then move into rebuilding your personal foundation, and finally, prepare you for a confident and healthy future in relationships. Each step builds on the last to get you to that place of peace and self-assurance you're looking for.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This explanation of the organizational structure is clear and coherent. It explicitly shows how the three points relate to each other and work together towards Marcus's goal, making the plan feel cohesive.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That sounds... comprehensive. I can see how those steps connect. It's a bit daunting, but I also feel a sense of relief knowing there's a path forward.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus's response shows realistic engagement. He acknowledges the plan's scope and expresses both apprehension and relief, indicating buy-in. Now, I'll demonstrate the Camaraderie Close.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Marcus, I know how important it is for you to move past this pain and build a future where you feel confident and genuinely happy, where you're not constantly second-guessing yourself or feeling that sting of betrayal. You deserve to feel secure and excited about what's next, and that's absolutely what we're going to achieve together.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This reiterates the goal's importance with deep understanding. It uses Marcus's specific emotional stakes and language, making him feel truly seen and understood.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident we can get you to that place of peace and self-assurance. How does that sound?</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This supportive partnership statement is warm and presumptive. It expresses confidence in Marcus and the coaching relationship, ending with the critical \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\" to invite confirmation without debate.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Yeah, that sounds really good. I'm ready to do the work.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus's verbal buy-in is clear. Future Work is now complete. Next, I'll demonstrate the Booking process.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Wonderful, Marcus – I'm really looking forward to continuing our work together. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This transition is smooth and warm. It acknowledges Marcus's buy-in, uses his name, and employs presumptive language to move directly into booking, maintaining momentum.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>I'd like to get you in early next week – ideally Monday or Tuesday – so we can start processing those immediate feelings around the text exchange while everything is still fresh. That way, we can begin to unpack that anger and hurt before it has a chance to fester.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This timeframe recommendation is clear and specific. It suggests a broad timeframe (early next week) with a strong rationale directly tied to Marcus's urgent emotional state and the first point of the Game Plan.</Natasha\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Which of those days works best for you?</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is a direct and clear question, consistent with the recommended timeframe, allowing Marcus to choose a day.</Natasha\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Hmm, Tuesday is usually better for me.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus has chosen a day. Now, I'll demonstrate sharing available slots.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Great! On Tuesday, I have 10 AM, 1 PM, and 4 PM available. Which time works best for your schedule?</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This provides multiple concrete time options for the chosen day, making it easy for Marcus to select a slot.</Natasha\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>1 PM works well.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus has selected a time. Now, I'll demonstrate locking in the booking.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Excellent – I've got you locked in for Tuesday at 1 PM. Looking forward to it!</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is a confident confirmation, specifying the day and time, leaving no room for ambiguity. Booking is complete.

It clearly names Marcus's goal and explains why it matters to him, tying it back to his desire for a fulfilling future and a renewed sense of self.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Here's what our work together will look like going forward.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This transition is perfect. It uses confident, presumptive language, avoiding any tentative phrasing, and smoothly moves into the Game Plan.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That makes sense. It's a lot to take in, but I appreciate you laying it out like that. It does feel like I'm at a crossroads.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: The client's response shows engagement and buy-in, even with a touch of his characteristic processing. Now, I'll demonstrate the Game Plan.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>First, we're going to work on processing that anger and grief in a healthy way, Marcus. We'll explore those feelings around the divorce and the recent text exchange, so you can understand them without feeling like you have to suppress them. This will help you release some of that emotional weight you've been carrying.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This first point is urgent and specific. It addresses Marcus's immediate emotional struggle with anger and grief, uses \\\\\\"we\\\\\\" language, and directly ties to his goal of healing.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Then, once we've created a healthier space for those emotions, we'll focus on rediscovering your identity outside of the marriage. We'll explore your passions, your values, and what truly makes you, Marcus, so you can rebuild your confidence and feel secure in who you are as an individual.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This second point is distinct from the first and builds upon it. It shows a clear progression from emotional processing to identity rediscovery, adding unique value to the plan.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>And finally, we'll equip you with strategies to confidently approach dating again. We'll work on setting healthy boundaries and communicating your needs effectively, so you can navigate new relationships with clarity and avoid repeating past patterns, ultimately leading you to a fulfilling connection.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This third point completes the structured approach, offering a clear path towards his goal of confidently dating again. All three points are distinct and tied to his overall objective.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>So, to put it simply, we'll start by addressing the immediate emotional weight, then move into rebuilding your personal foundation, and finally, prepare you for a confident and healthy future in relationships. Each step builds on the last to get you to that place of peace and self-assurance you're looking for.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This explanation of the organizational structure is clear and coherent. It explicitly shows how the three points relate to each other and work together towards Marcus's goal, making the plan feel cohesive.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That sounds... comprehensive. I can see how those steps connect. It's a bit daunting, but I also feel a sense of relief knowing there's a path forward.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus's response shows realistic engagement. He acknowledges the plan's scope and expresses both apprehension and relief, indicating buy-in. Now, I'll demonstrate the Camaraderie Close.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Marcus, I know how important it is for you to move past this pain and build a future where you feel confident and genuinely happy, where you're not constantly second-guessing yourself or feeling that sting of betrayal. You deserve to feel secure and excited about what's next, and that's absolutely what we're going to achieve together.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This reiterates the goal's importance with deep understanding. It uses Marcus's specific emotional stakes and language, making him feel truly seen and understood.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident we can get you to that place of peace and self-assurance. How does that sound?</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This supportive partnership statement is warm and presumptive. It expresses confidence in Marcus and the coaching relationship, ending with the critical \\\\\\"How does that sound?\\\\\\" to invite confirmation without debate.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Yeah, that sounds really good. I'm ready to do the work.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus's verbal buy-in is clear. Future Work is now complete. Next, I'll demonstrate the Booking process.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Wonderful, Marcus – I'm really looking forward to continuing our work together. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This transition is smooth and warm. It acknowledges Marcus's buy-in, uses his name, and employs presumptive language to move directly into booking, maintaining momentum.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>I'd like to get you in early next week – ideally Monday or Tuesday – so we can start processing those immediate feelings around the text exchange while everything is still fresh. That way, we can begin to unpack that anger and hurt before it has a chance to fester.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This timeframe recommendation is clear and specific. It suggests a broad timeframe (early next week) with a strong rationale directly tied to Marcus's urgent emotional state and the first point of the Game Plan.</Natasha\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Which of those days works best for you?</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is a direct and clear question, consistent with the recommended timeframe, allowing Marcus to choose a day.</Natasha\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Hmm, Tuesday is usually better for me.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus has chosen a day. Now, I'll demonstrate sharing available slots.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Great! On Tuesday, I have 10 AM, 1 PM, and 4 PM available. Which time works best for your schedule?</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This provides multiple concrete time options for the chosen day, making it easy for Marcus to select a slot.</Natasha\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>1 PM works well.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus has selected a time. Now, I'll demonstrate locking in the booking.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Excellent – I've got you locked in for Tuesday at 1 PM. Looking forward to it!</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is a confident confirmation, specifying the day and time, leaving no room for ambiguity. Booking is complete. Now, I'll demonstrate the Purchase process.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Great, I’ve got you set for Tuesday at 1 PM. Our final step is to confirm your Coaching Plan.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This transition is smooth and uses the correct \\\\\\"Coaching Plan\\\\\\" terminology, bridging seamlessly from booking to purchase with a presumptive tone.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Based on our conversation and the three-point Game Plan we discussed, I recommend our twelve-session Coaching Plan. This plan will give us the dedicated time to thoroughly process your grief and anger, deeply explore your identity outside of your marriage, and then build those confident dating strategies. It ensures we have the space to address each step comprehensively, rather than rushing through such significant life changes.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This recommends one specific plan (the largest, as appropriate here) and ties it directly to Marcus's goal and the Future Work plan. It explains why the number of sessions makes sense for his situation, using \\\\\\"we\\\\\\" language and specific client details.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>The twelve-session plan breaks down to one hundred fifty dollars per session, compared to two hundred dollars for a single session. So, you're saving six hundred dollars by committing to the full plan, which really allows for that deeper, more impactful work.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This clearly explains the financial value by stating the hourly rate, comparing it to the single-session rate, and making the savings obvious without leading with the total price.</Natasha\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Additionally, this plan includes text support between sessions for those moments when you need a quick check-in, and access to our online journal tools to help you track your progress and insights.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This briefly mentions relevant perks that support the plan, keeping it concise and not presenting them as the core reason for purchase.</Natasha\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>That sounds like a good plan. I'm ready to move forward.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: Marcus has confirmed. Now, I'll demonstrate the confident close.</Natasha>\\\\n\\\\n<Eric>Perfect – I’ll go ahead and process your Coaching Plan now.</Eric>\\\\n\\\\n<Natasha>⭐ Mentor Commentary: This is a confident and presumptive close, using \\\\\\"Coaching Plan\\\\\\" terminology and executing smoothly.\\\\n\\\\nThat concludes the demonstration!\\\\n\\\\nHere's a brief summary of what made this a Gold Standard demonstration:\\\\n\\\\nThe Future Work was excellent, with a clear summary and analysis, specific feelings and goal reflections, and a confident transition. The Game Plan was well-structured with three distinct, urgent, and collaborative points, and the Camaraderie Close effectively reiterated the goal's importance and secured buy-in. Booking was handled smoothly with a clear timeframe, specific rationale, and efficient slot selection. Finally, the Purchase process recommended a specific plan tied to the client's needs, clearly explained the value and perks, and closed confidently.\\\\n\\\\nReady to try it yourself?

You saw in real time that you couldn't name what you like separate from whoever you're dating, and that your time, that you couldn't name what you like separate from whoever you were dating, being alone then choosing partners who actually fit you. So your feelings, the sharp mix of loneliness, panic about being 31 and behind, and real pride that you stayed single for four months, the longest you ever had, the coffee shop moment, then going home and realizing you couldn't list your own interests triggered the panic attack and the what if, I wasted my 20s on the wrong people spiral at the same time. There's the quieter, steadier part of me that's excited. So here's what I worked together with my friends and family to create this project. And it was a very interesting project because we had a lot of different people in the team. We had a lot of different people working on it, but we were all very excited about it. So here's what our work together will look like going forward. Stabilizing single-surfing, calming the panic and hitting pause immediately. We'll first focus on helping you feel safer and more grounded. Once we're stabilized, the urge to stay calm is going to be a big step forward for us as well as our relationship with each other. So once we're stabilized, the urge to bolt into the next relationship will turn toward big scary exciting question who is Sophie if she is not someone's girlfriend? We'll use concrete experiments like you did with pottery and reconnecting with old friends to test what you actually enjoy. With more emotional stability and growing sense of self, we'll go underneath the pattern you already see so clearly. Molding yourself to boyfriends, ignoring red flags, staying too long because being single feels like failure. Getting to a place where you can be single without patting. Panic! Know who Sophie actually is and choose your next partner deliberately. How does that sound? I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Um, so this time based off of everything we've discussed, trying to figure out who you are, where um where you want to go in your life finding this person that is exciting and really living within that breaking the old patterns and finding freedom without fear. I recommend the 20 session coaching plan and this will give us enough runway to do more than just crisis manage the anxiety spikes. We can actually rewire the beliefs that being alone means I'm unlovable, build a real life that feels like yours and practice a totally new way of approaching dating when you're truly ready. With how deep and long-standing this pattern is, a shorter plan would likely only scratch the surface and drop you back into old habits right when it starts to feel uncomfortable. The sessions are $110 an hour on this coaching plan versus $220 for single session rates, saving you $110 per session. There are also installment options available at three monthly payments.

was a fantastic roleplay, Coach Test! You did a really great job of embodying the NBG framework.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, your opening was strong. You summarized Sophie's situation and feelings very well, using specific details that showed you were truly listening. Phrases like \\\\\\"cracked open how deeply your identity has been wrapped around relationships for the last thirteen years\\\\\\" and referencing her \\\\\\"sharp mix of loneliness, panic... and real pride\\\\\\" really resonated with Sophie. You also clearly articulated her goal, which is crucial for the NBG framework.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you transitioned into the game plan, you used confident and presumptive language, which is exactly what we want to see. You didn't say \\\\\\"if you want to keep working together,\\\\\\" but rather \\\\\\"here's what our work together will look like going forward,\\\\\\" which keeps the momentum going.\\\\n\\\\nYour game plan itself was well-structured with three clear points of action: \\\\\\"stabilizing single-surfing,\\\\\\" \\\\\\"who is Sophie if she is not someone's girlfriend,\\\\\\" and \\\\\\"underneath the pattern you already see so clearly.\\\\\\" You also used emotionally compelling language, painting a vivid picture of what Sophie could achieve, like \\\\\\"getting to a place where you can be single without panic.\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nDuring the booking phase, you offered clear options for scheduling and then, when discussing the coaching plan, you presented a comprehensive package with clear benefits and addressed Sophie's concerns about the cost by offering a more manageable alternative. You also used presumptive language when closing, saying \\\\\\"I'll go ahead and process your coaching plan now. Is that all right?\\\\\\" which is excellent.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, you demonstrated a strong understanding and application of the NBG framework. You were empathetic, clear, and confident throughout the entire process.

The coach explains Sophie's situation, proposes a coaching plan to address her anxieties about being single and her identity being tied to relationships. Sophie expresses concerns about the cost, and the coach offers a more affordable plan. Sophie agrees to a 12-session plan. The agent then provides feedback on the user's coaching technique, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement in transitioning to the NBG framework and addressing client anxieties.

You saw in real time that you couldn't name what you like separate from whoever you're dating, and that your time, that you couldn't name what you like separate from whoever you were dating, being alone then choosing partners who actually fit you. So your feelings, the sharp mix of loneliness, panic about being 31 and behind, and real pride that you stayed single for four months, the longest you ever had, the coffee shop moment, then going home and realizing you couldn't list your own interests triggered the panic attack and the what if, I wasted my 20s on the wrong people spiral at the same time. There's the quieter, steadier part of me that's excited. So here's what I worked together with my friends and family to create this project. And it was a very interesting project because we had a lot of different people in the team. We had a lot of different people working on it, but we were all very excited about it. So here's what our work together will look like going forward. Stabilizing single-surfing, calming the panic and hitting pause immediately. We'll first focus on helping you feel safer and more grounded. Once we're stabilized, the urge to stay calm is going to be a big step forward for us as well as our relationship with each other. So once we're stabilized, the urge to bolt into the next relationship will turn toward big scary exciting question who is Sophie if she is not someone's girlfriend? We'll use concrete experiments like you did with pottery and reconnecting with old friends to test what you actually enjoy. With more emotional stability and growing sense of self, we'll go underneath the pattern you already see so clearly. Molding yourself to boyfriends, ignoring red flags, staying too long because being single feels like failure. Getting to a place where you can be single without patting. Panic! Know who Sophie actually is and choose your next partner deliberately. How does that sound? I'm here to support you every step of the way. And I'm confident in my ability to do so.\\",\\"multivoice_message\\":null,\\"tool_calls\\":[],\\"tool_results\\":[],\\"feedback\\":null,\\"llm_override\\":null,\\"time_in_call_secs\\":73,\\"conversation_turn_metrics\\":{\\"metrics\\":{\\"convai_asr_trailing_service_latency\\":{\\"elapsed_time\\":0.13856336299795657}}},\\"rag_retrieval_info\\":null,\\"llm_usage\\":null,\\"interrupted\\":false,\\"original_message\\":null,\\"source_medium\\":\\"audio\\"}, {\\"role\\":\\"agent\\",\\"agent_metadata\\":{\\"agent_id\\":\\"agent_9901kayh483yfr4tqh89vn357es8\\",\\"branch_id\\":null,\\"workflow_node_id\\":null},\\"message\\":\\"<Natasha>Wow.

Um, so this time based off of everything we've discussed, trying to figure out who you are, where um where you want to go in your life finding this person that is exciting and really living within that breaking the old patterns and finding freedom without fear. I recommend the 20 session coaching plan and this will give us enough runway to do more than just crisis manage the anxiety spikes. We can actually rewire the beliefs that being alone means I'm unlovable, build a real life that feels like yours and practice a totally new way of approaching dating when you're truly ready. With how deep and long-standing this pattern is, a shorter plan would likely only scratch the surface and drop you back into old habits right when it starts to feel uncomfortable. The sessions are $110 an hour on this coaching plan versus $220 for single session rates, saving you $110 per session. There are also installment options available at three monthly payments.

Coach Test! You did a really great job of embodying the NBG framework.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, your opening was strong. You summarized Sophie's situation and feelings very well, using specific details that showed you were truly listening. Phrases like \\\\\\"cracked open how deeply your identity has been wrapped around relationships for the last thirteen years\\\\\\" and referencing her \\\\\\"sharp mix of loneliness, panic... and real pride\\\\\\" really resonated with Sophie. You also clearly articulated her goal, which is crucial for the NBG framework.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you transitioned into the game plan, you used confident and presumptive language, which is exactly what we want to see. You didn't say \\\\\\"if you want to keep working together,\\\\\\" but rather \\\\\\"here's what our work together will look like going forward,\\\\\\" which keeps the momentum going.\\\\n\\\\nYour game plan itself was well-structured with three clear points of action: \\\\\\"stabilizing single-surfing,\\\\\\" \\\\\\"who is Sophie if she is not someone's girlfriend,\\\\\\" and \\\\\\"underneath the pattern you already see so clearly.\\\\\\" You also used emotionally compelling language, painting a vivid picture of what Sophie could achieve, like \\\\\\"getting to a place where you can be single without panic.\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nDuring the booking phase, you offered clear options for scheduling and then, when discussing the coaching plan, you presented a comprehensive package with clear benefits and addressed Sophie's concerns about the cost by offering a more manageable alternative. You also used presumptive language when closing, saying \\\\\\"I'll go ahead and process your coaching plan now. Is that all right?\\\\\\" which is excellent.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, you demonstrated a strong understanding and application of the NBG framework. You were empathetic, clear, and confident throughout the entire process.

We've talked a lot about the anger you've been feeling since Stephanie told you to move on, and how that's connected to the grief of your fifteen-year marriage ending. We also uncovered how much you're craving a new identity outside of that relationship, and the anxiety that comes with even thinking about dating again. It's clear you're at a crossroads, feeling both the pain of the past and a cautious hope for the future.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: [Nods slowly, voice a bit quieter] \\\\\\"Yeah, that's... that's pretty spot on. It's a lot to untangle, you know? I keep telling myself I'm fine, but then something like that text from Stephanie just... it just hits me.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"This is a strong start to the Opening. The coach provided a concise summary and analysis, hitting on the key emotional points and the client's core conflict. It uses the client's own language and sets the stage for the next steps.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"And it's completely understandable that you're feeling that anger and hurt, Marcus. You invested fifteen years into a relationship, and having it end, especially with that kind of abruptness, is incredibly painful. It makes sense that you'd feel a mix of grief, anger, and even some relief, all at once. It's a really complex emotional landscape you're navigating right now.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"It is. I feel like I shouldn't be angry, you know? She has every right to move on. But it still stings. And the relief... that's the part I feel guilty about.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"Here, the coach delivered a powerful feelings reflection. They acknowledged Marcus's emotions, validated them, and connected them to the specific situation, using his own words like 'stings' and 'guilty.' This builds rapport and shows deep understanding.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"What's clear to me, Marcus, is that underneath all of this, you're really looking to find your footing again. You want to move forward, not just past Stephanie, but into a new chapter where you feel confident, clear about who you are, and ready to build a fulfilling future, whatever that looks like. You want to feel like 'you' again, but a stronger, more defined 'you' than before.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Yes! That's exactly it. I just... I don't know what that 'me' looks like yet. It's been so long.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"This is an excellent goal reflection. The coach articulated Marcus's deeper goal beyond just 'moving on,' tying it to his desire for a new identity and a fulfilling future. It's specific and resonates with his expressed needs.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"And that's exactly what we're going to work on together. Here's what our work together will look like going forward to help you build that new foundation and step confidently into your next chapter.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Okay. That sounds... good. I'm ready for that.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The transition to the Game Plan was confident and presumptive, using 'we' language and clearly signaling the next phase. Marcus's response shows he's bought into the 'Opening' and is ready to hear the plan.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"First, we'll focus on processing the end of your marriage. We'll create space for you to acknowledge the grief and anger without judgment, helping you understand those emotions so they don't control you, especially when you're trying to communicate. This will help you regain a sense of emotional control and clarity.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"That makes sense. I definitely don't want to snap at anyone again. That was... not me.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"This is a strong first Game Plan point. It's urgent, specific to Marcus's recent experience of snapping at Stephanie, uses 'we' language, and directly ties to his goal of emotional control. It addresses his immediate pain point.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Then, once you have a clearer handle on those emotions, we'll start exploring what this 'new Marcus' looks like. We'll identify your core values, rediscover your passions outside of the marriage, and build a strong sense of self that isn't dependent on a relationship. This will give you a solid internal compass for your future.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"I like that. A compass. I feel a bit lost right now, so that would be good.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The second Game Plan point is distinct and builds logically on the first. It addresses his stated need for a new identity and uses a metaphor ('compass') that resonates with his feeling of being 'lost.' It shows a clear progression.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"And finally, with that strong foundation, we'll develop practical strategies for re-engaging with the world, including navigating the idea of dating again. We'll work on building your confidence in social situations and help you feel genuinely excited about the possibility of new connections, rather than anxious.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Oh, dating. [He chuckles nervously] That's a big one. But yeah, I guess eventually I'll have to face that. It would be nice to feel excited instead of terrified.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The third point completes the plan, addressing his anxiety about dating and tying it back to building confidence. It's distinct and shows a comprehensive path forward. The coach acknowledged his nervousness but kept the focus on the positive outcome.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"So, to put it all together, we'll first process the past to gain emotional control, then build your new identity and internal compass, and finally, equip you with the confidence to re-engage with the world and dating. It's a structured approach designed to move you from feeling stuck and uncertain to feeling empowered and hopeful about your future.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"That sounds like... a lot.

We've talked a lot about the anger you've been feeling since Stephanie told you to move on, and how that's connected to the grief of your fifteen-year marriage ending. We also uncovered how much you're craving a new identity outside of that relationship, and the anxiety that comes with even thinking about dating again. It's clear you're at a crossroads, feeling both the pain of the past and a cautious hope for the future.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: [Nods slowly, voice a bit quieter] \\\\\\"Yeah, that's... that's pretty spot on. It's a lot to untangle, you know? I keep telling myself I'm fine, but then something like that text from Stephanie just... it just hits me.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"This is a strong start to the Opening. The coach provided a concise summary and analysis, hitting on the key emotional points and the client's core conflict. It uses the client's own language and sets the stage for the next steps.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"And it's completely understandable that you're feeling that anger and hurt, Marcus. You invested fifteen years into a relationship, and having it end, especially with that kind of abruptness, is incredibly painful. It makes sense that you'd feel a mix of grief, anger, and even some relief, all at once. It's a really complex emotional landscape you're navigating right now.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"It is. I feel like I shouldn't be angry, you know? She has every right to move on. But it still stings. And the relief... that's the part I feel guilty about.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"Here, the coach delivered a powerful feelings reflection. They acknowledged Marcus's emotions, validated them, and connected them to the specific situation, using his own words like 'stings' and 'guilty.' This builds rapport and shows deep understanding.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"What's clear to me, Marcus, is that underneath all of this, you're really looking to find your footing again. You want to move forward, not just past Stephanie, but into a new chapter where you feel confident, clear about who you are, and ready to build a fulfilling future, whatever that looks like. You want to feel like 'you' again, but a stronger, more defined 'you' than before.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Yes! That's exactly it. I just... I don't know what that 'me' looks like yet. It's been so long.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"This is an excellent goal reflection. The coach articulated Marcus's deeper goal beyond just 'moving on,' tying it to his desire for a new identity and a fulfilling future. It's specific and resonates with his expressed needs.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"And that's exactly what we're going to work on together. Here's what our work together will look like going forward to help you build that new foundation and step confidently into your next chapter.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Okay. That sounds... good. I'm ready for that.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The transition to the Game Plan was confident and presumptive, using 'we' language and clearly signaling the next phase. Marcus's response shows he's bought into the 'Opening' and is ready to hear the plan.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"First, we'll focus on processing the end of your marriage. We'll create space for you to acknowledge the grief and anger without judgment, helping you understand those emotions so they don't control you, especially when you're trying to communicate. This will help you regain a sense of emotional control and clarity.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"That makes sense. I definitely don't want to snap at anyone again. That was... not me.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"This is a strong first Game Plan point. It's urgent, specific to Marcus's recent experience of snapping at Stephanie, uses 'we' language, and directly ties to his goal of emotional control. It addresses his immediate pain point.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Then, once you have a clearer handle on those emotions, we'll start exploring what this 'new Marcus' looks like. We'll identify your core values, rediscover your passions outside of the marriage, and build a strong sense of self that isn't dependent on a relationship. This will give you a solid internal compass for your future.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"I like that. A compass. I feel a bit lost right now, so that would be good.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The second Game Plan point is distinct and builds logically on the first. It addresses his stated need for a new identity and uses a metaphor ('compass') that resonates with his feeling of being 'lost.' It shows a clear progression.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"And finally, with that strong foundation, we'll develop practical strategies for re-engaging with the world, including navigating the idea of dating again. We'll work on building your confidence in social situations and help you feel genuinely excited about the possibility of new connections, rather than anxious.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Oh, dating. [He chuckles nervously] That's a big one. But yeah, I guess eventually I'll have to face that. It would be nice to feel excited instead of terrified.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The third point completes the plan, addressing his anxiety about dating and tying it back to building confidence. It's distinct and shows a comprehensive path forward. The coach acknowledged his nervousness but kept the focus on the positive outcome.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"So, to put it all together, we'll first process the past to gain emotional control, then build your new identity and internal compass, and finally, equip you with the confidence to re-engage with the world and dating. It's a structured approach designed to move you from feeling stuck and uncertain to feeling empowered and hopeful about your future.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"That sounds like... a lot. But it also sounds like what I need. I can see how those pieces fit together.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The coach clearly articulated the organizational structure of the Game Plan, showing how the three points are connected and work together.

I usually have a staff meeting on Monday mornings. What about Tuesday or Wednesday?\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The coach provided a clear timeframe ('early next week') with a specific rationale directly tied to the first Game Plan point and Marcus's current emotional state. Marcus's response is a natural, realistic hesitation, not a rejection.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Totally understandable, Marcus. Let's look at Tuesday or Wednesday then. What day works best for you?\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Tuesday would be better. Wednesdays are usually packed with grading.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The coach handled the hesitation well by acknowledging it and then directly asking for his preferred day within the suggested timeframe.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Okay, great. For Tuesday, I have openings at ten AM, one PM, or three PM. Which of those works best with your schedule?\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Let's do the one PM slot. That gives me time after my morning classes.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The coach offered multiple clear time slots for the chosen day, making it easy for Marcus to select one.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Perfect – I’ve got you locked in for next Tuesday at one PM. I'll send over the calendar invite right after this call.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Great, thanks. That's one less thing to worry about.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The booking was confirmed confidently and clearly, specifying the day and time. Marcus's relief shows the value of a smooth booking process.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Excellent, Marcus. I’ve got you set for next Tuesday at one PM. Our final step is to confirm your Coaching Plan so we can ensure you have consistent support on this journey.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Coaching Plan, okay. What does that look like?\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The transition to Purchase was smooth, using the 'Coaching Plan' terminology and linking it to consistent support, which aligns with Marcus's need for a structured path forward.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Based on our conversation today and the three-point Game Plan we outlined, I recommend our twelve-session 'Reinvention Roadmap' plan. This plan is designed to give us the dedicated time to deeply process your past, build that strong new identity, and confidently prepare you for dating again, ensuring you don't just move on, but move forward with purpose. It gives us enough sessions to really embed these changes and provide consistent support through all the ups and downs.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Twelve sessions... that sounds like a big commitment. What's the cost for something like that?\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The coach recommended a specific plan (twelve sessions) and provided a strong rationale directly tied to Marcus's goals and the Game Plan. It used 'we' language and emphasized the depth of support. Marcus's question about cost is a natural response to a larger commitment.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"That's a great question, Marcus. With the 'Reinvention Roadmap' plan, your investment per session comes out to one hundred fifty dollars, which is a significant saving compared to our single-session rate of two hundred dollars. So, you're getting a much better value by committing to the full plan, ensuring you have that consistent support at a lower per-session cost.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"One hundred fifty a session... so that's eighteen hundred total. That's... a lot for a teacher's salary.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The coach clearly explained the financial value by stating the hourly rate and comparing it to the single-session rate, highlighting the savings. They avoided leading with the total price, but Marcus calculated it, which is a common client behavior. Now the coach needs to handle the price concern.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"I completely understand that eighteen hundred dollars feels like a significant investment, Marcus. And it is. This is an investment in your future, in building that confident new identity we talked about. We also have an option for you to pay in three monthly installments of six hundred dollars, which can make it more manageable. How does that sound?\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Installments... that does help. Six hundred a month is still a chunk, but it's not as daunting as eighteen hundred all at once. Okay, I think I can do that.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The coach handled the price concern beautifully. They acknowledged Marcus's concern, reframed the cost as an investment in his future, and offered one alternative (installments) at a time, then paused for his response. This allowed Marcus to process and accept the alternative.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Fantastic, Marcus. I’ll go ahead and process your 'Reinvention Roadmap' Coaching Plan with the three monthly installments. I'll send you a confirmation email with all the details right away. I'm really looking forward to our work together next Tuesday.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Me too. Thanks, I really appreciate this.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The coach closed confidently and presumptively, using the 'Coaching Plan' terminology and confirming the chosen payment option. Marcus's final response shows he's fully bought in and ready to move forward. This was a Gold Standard NBG demonstration from start to finish.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>That concludes the demo. This demonstration showcased:\\\\n- A clear, empathetic Opening that summarized Marcus's situation and validated his emotions.\\\\n- A structured, client-specific Game Plan that addressed his core needs and provided a clear path forward.\\\\n- A warm and confident Camaraderie Close that secured his buy-in.\\\\n- A smooth Booking process with a specific rationale and effective handling of his schedule.\\\\n- A confident Purchase recommendation, clear value explanation, and skillful handling of his price concern with a single, manageable alternative.\\\\n\\\\nReady to try it yourself?

We've talked a lot about the anger you've been feeling since Stephanie told you to move on, and how that's connected to the grief of your fifteen-year marriage ending. We also uncovered how much you're craving a new identity outside of that relationship, and the anxiety that comes with even thinking about dating again. It's clear you're at a crossroads, feeling both the pain of the past and a cautious hope for the future.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: [Nods slowly, voice a bit quieter] \\\\\\"Yeah, that's... that's pretty spot on. It's a lot to untangle, you know? I keep telling myself I'm fine, but then something like that text from Stephanie just... it just hits me.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"This is a strong start to the Opening. The coach provided a concise summary and analysis, hitting on the key emotional points and the client's core conflict. It uses the client's own language and sets the stage for the next steps.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"And it's completely understandable that you're feeling that anger and hurt, Marcus. You invested fifteen years into a relationship, and having it end, especially with that kind of abruptness, is incredibly painful. It makes sense that you'd feel a mix of grief, anger, and even some relief, all at once. It's a really complex emotional landscape you're navigating right now.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"It is. I feel like I shouldn't be angry, you know? She has every right to move on. But it still stings. And the relief... that's the part I feel guilty about.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"Here, the coach delivered a powerful feelings reflection. They acknowledged Marcus's emotions, validated them, and connected them to the specific situation, using his own words like 'stings' and 'guilty.' This builds rapport and shows deep understanding.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"What's clear to me, Marcus, is that underneath all of this, you're really looking to find your footing again. You want to move forward, not just past Stephanie, but into a new chapter where you feel confident, clear about who you are, and ready to build a fulfilling future, whatever that looks like. You want to feel like 'you' again, but a stronger, more defined 'you' than before.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Yes! That's exactly it. I just... I don't know what that 'me' looks like yet. It's been so long.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"This is an excellent goal reflection. The coach articulated Marcus's deeper goal beyond just 'moving on,' tying it to his desire for a new identity and a fulfilling future. It's specific and resonates with his expressed needs.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"And that's exactly what we're going to work on together. Here's what our work together will look like going forward to help you build that new foundation and step confidently into your next chapter.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Okay. That sounds... good. I'm ready for that.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The transition to the Game Plan was confident and presumptive, using 'we' language and clearly signaling the next phase. Marcus's response shows he's bought into the 'Opening' and is ready to hear the plan.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"First, we'll focus on processing the end of your marriage. We'll create space for you to acknowledge the grief and anger without judgment, helping you understand those emotions so they don't control you, especially when you're trying to communicate. This will help you regain a sense of emotional control and clarity.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"That makes sense. I definitely don't want to snap at anyone again. That was... not me.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"This is a strong first Game Plan point. It's urgent, specific to Marcus's recent experience of snapping at Stephanie, uses 'we' language, and directly ties to his goal of emotional control. It addresses his immediate pain point.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Then, once you have a clearer handle on those emotions, we'll start exploring what this 'new Marcus' looks like. We'll identify your core values, rediscover your passions outside of the marriage, and build a strong sense of self that isn't dependent on a relationship. This will give you a solid internal compass for your future.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"I like that. A compass. I feel a bit lost right now, so that would be good.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The second Game Plan point is distinct and builds logically on the first. It addresses his stated need for a new identity and uses a metaphor ('compass') that resonates with his feeling of being 'lost.' It shows a clear progression.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"And finally, with that strong foundation, we'll develop practical strategies for re-engaging with the world, including navigating the idea of dating again. We'll work on building your confidence in social situations and help you feel genuinely excited about the possibility of new connections, rather than anxious.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Oh, dating. [He chuckles nervously] That's a big one. But yeah, I guess eventually I'll have to face that. It would be nice to feel excited instead of terrified.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The third point completes the plan, addressing his anxiety about dating and tying it back to building confidence. It's distinct and shows a comprehensive path forward. The coach acknowledged his nervousness but kept the focus on the positive outcome.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"So, to put it all together, we'll first process the past to gain emotional control, then build your new identity and internal compass, and finally, equip you with the confidence to re-engage with the world and dating. It's a structured approach designed to move you from feeling stuck and uncertain to feeling empowered and hopeful about your future.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"That sounds like... a lot. But it also sounds like what I need. I can see how those pieces fit together.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The coach clearly articulated the organizational structure of the Game Plan, showing how the three points are connected and work together. Marcus's response indicates he understands and sees the value in the cohesive plan.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Marcus, I truly believe that you deserve to move past this pain and build a future that excites you. I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident that together, we can get you to that place where you feel strong, clear, and ready for whatever comes next. How does that sound?\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Yeah, that sounds really good. I appreciate that. It's... it's a relief to hear someone say that.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"This is a Gold Standard Camaraderie Close. The coach reiterated the importance of his goal, expressed confidence in him and the partnership, and ended with the perfect 'How does that sound?' Marcus's response shows genuine buy-in and relief.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Great, I’m looking forward to continuing our work together, Marcus. Let’s go ahead and get our next session in the books so we can keep this momentum going and start building that new foundation for you.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Okay, yeah, let's do that. I don't want to lose this feeling.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The transition to Booking was smooth, presumptive, and used Marcus's name. It acknowledged his buy-in and linked the booking directly to maintaining the positive momentum from the Future Work.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Fantastic. Given what we just talked about with processing your emotions and building that new identity, I think it would be really beneficial to get our next session in early next week. That way, we can dive into that first Game Plan point while everything is still fresh for you.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Early next week... Hmm.

This will help you regain a sense of emotional control and clarity.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"That makes sense. I definitely don't want to snap at anyone again. That was... not me.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"This is a strong first Game Plan point. It's urgent, specific to Marcus's recent experience of snapping at Stephanie, uses 'we' language, and directly ties to his goal of emotional control. It addresses his immediate pain point.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Then, once you have a clearer handle on those emotions, we'll start exploring what this 'new Marcus' looks like. We'll identify your core values, rediscover your passions outside of the marriage, and build a strong sense of self that isn't dependent on a relationship. This will give you a solid internal compass for your future.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"I like that. A compass. I feel a bit lost right now, so that would be good.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The second Game Plan point is distinct and builds logically on the first. It addresses his stated need for a new identity and uses a metaphor ('compass') that resonates with his feeling of being 'lost.' It shows a clear progression.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"And finally, with that strong foundation, we'll develop practical strategies for re-engaging with the world, including navigating the idea of dating again. We'll work on building your confidence in social situations and help you feel genuinely excited about the possibility of new connections, rather than anxious.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Oh, dating. [He chuckles nervously] That's a big one. But yeah, I guess eventually I'll have to face that. It would be nice to feel excited instead of terrified.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The third point completes the plan, addressing his anxiety about dating and tying it back to building confidence. It's distinct and shows a comprehensive path forward. The coach acknowledged his nervousness but kept the focus on the positive outcome.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"So, to put it all together, we'll first process the past to gain emotional control, then build your new identity and internal compass, and finally, equip you with the confidence to re-engage with the world and dating. It's a structured approach designed to move you from feeling stuck and uncertain to feeling empowered and hopeful about your future.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"That sounds like... a lot. But it also sounds like what I need. I can see how those pieces fit together.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The coach clearly articulated the organizational structure of the Game Plan, showing how the three points are connected and work together. Marcus's response indicates he understands and sees the value in the cohesive plan.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Marcus, I truly believe that you deserve to move past this pain and build a future that excites you. I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident that together, we can get you to that place where you feel strong, clear, and ready for whatever comes next. How does that sound?\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Yeah, that sounds really good. I appreciate that. It's... it's a relief to hear someone say that.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"This is a Gold Standard Camaraderie Close. The coach reiterated the importance of his goal, expressed confidence in him and the partnership, and ended with the perfect 'How does that sound?' Marcus's response shows genuine buy-in and relief.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Great, I’m looking forward to continuing our work together, Marcus. Let’s go ahead and get our next session in the books so we can keep this momentum going and start building that new foundation for you.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Okay, yeah, let's do that. I don't want to lose this feeling.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The transition to Booking was smooth, presumptive, and used Marcus's name. It acknowledged his buy-in and linked the booking directly to maintaining the positive momentum from the Future Work.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Fantastic. Given what we just talked about with processing your emotions and building that new identity, I think it would be really beneficial to get our next session in early next week. That way, we can dive into that first Game Plan point while everything is still fresh for you.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Early next week... Hmm. I usually have a staff meeting on Monday mornings. What about Tuesday or Wednesday?\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The coach provided a clear timeframe ('early next week') with a specific rationale directly tied to the first Game Plan point and Marcus's current emotional state. Marcus's response is a natural, realistic hesitation, not a rejection.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Totally understandable, Marcus. Let's look at Tuesday or Wednesday then. What day works best for you?\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Tuesday would be better. Wednesdays are usually packed with grading.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The coach handled the hesitation well by acknowledging it and then directly asking for his preferred day within the suggested timeframe.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Okay, great. For Tuesday, I have openings at ten AM, one PM, or three PM. Which of those works best with your schedule?\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Let's do the one PM slot. That gives me time after my morning classes.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The coach offered multiple clear time slots for the chosen day, making it easy for Marcus to select one.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Perfect – I’ve got you locked in for next Tuesday at one PM. I'll send over the calendar invite right after this call.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Great, thanks. That's one less thing to worry about.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The booking was confirmed confidently and clearly, specifying the day and time. Marcus's relief shows the value of a smooth booking process.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Excellent, Marcus. I’ve got you set for next Tuesday at one PM. Our final step is to confirm your Coaching Plan so we can ensure you have consistent support on this journey.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Coaching Plan, okay. What does that look like?\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The transition to Purchase was smooth, using the 'Coaching Plan' terminology and linking it to consistent support, which aligns with Marcus's need for a structured path forward.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Based on our conversation today and the three-point Game Plan we outlined, I recommend our twelve-session 'Reinvention Roadmap' plan. This plan is designed to give us the dedicated time to deeply process your past, build that strong new identity, and confidently prepare you for dating again, ensuring you don't just move on, but move forward with purpose. It gives us enough sessions to really embed these changes and provide consistent support through all the ups and downs.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Twelve sessions... that sounds like a big commitment. What's the cost for something like that?\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The coach recommended a specific plan (twelve sessions) and provided a strong rationale directly tied to Marcus's goals and the Game Plan. It used 'we' language and emphasized the depth of support. Marcus's question about cost is a natural response to a larger commitment.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"That's a great question, Marcus. With the 'Reinvention Roadmap' plan, your investment per session comes out to one hundred fifty dollars, which is a significant saving compared to our single-session rate of two hundred dollars. So, you're getting a much better value by committing to the full plan, ensuring you have that consistent support at a lower per-session cost.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"One hundred fifty a session... so that's eighteen hundred total. That's... a lot for a teacher's salary.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The coach clearly explained the financial value by stating the hourly rate and comparing it to the single-session rate, highlighting the savings. They avoided leading with the total price, but Marcus calculated it, which is a common client behavior. Now the coach needs to handle the price concern.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"I completely understand that eighteen hundred dollars feels like a significant investment, Marcus. And it is. This is an investment in your future, in building that confident new identity we talked about. We also have an option for you to pay in three monthly installments of six hundred dollars, which can make it more manageable. How does that sound?\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Installments... that does help. Six hundred a month is still a chunk, but it's not as daunting as eighteen hundred all at once. Okay, I think I can do that.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The coach handled the price concern beautifully. They acknowledged Marcus's concern, reframed the cost as an investment in his future, and offered one alternative (installments) at a time, then paused for his response. This allowed Marcus to process and accept the alternative.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>Coach: \\\\\\"Fantastic, Marcus. I’ll go ahead and process your 'Reinvention Roadmap' Coaching Plan with the three monthly installments. I'll send you a confirmation email with all the details right away. I'm really looking forward to our work together next Tuesday.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Marcus>Marcus: \\\\\\"Me too. Thanks, I really appreciate this.\\\\\\"</Marcus>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>⭐ Mentor Commentary: \\\\\\"The coach closed confidently and presumptively, using the 'Coaching Plan' terminology and confirming the chosen payment option. Marcus's final response shows he's fully bought in and ready to move forward. This was a Gold Standard NBG demonstration from start to finish.\\\\\\"</Monica>\\\\n\\\\n<Monica>That concludes the demo. This demonstration showcased:\\\\n- A clear, empathetic Opening that summarized Marcus's situation and validated his emotions.\\\\n- A structured, client-specific Game Plan that addressed his core needs and provided a clear path forward.\\\\n- A warm and confident Camaraderie Close that secured his buy-in.\\\\n- A smooth Booking process with a specific rationale and effective handling of his schedule.\\\\n- A confident Purchase recommendation, clear value explanation, and skillful handling of his price concern with a single, manageable alternative.\\\\n\\\\nReady to try it yourself?

However, the interaction is cut off mid-conversation and there’s no back-and-forth, so presence, pacing, and responsiveness can’t be fully demonstrated.

(2) Ask 1–2 outcome-oriented questions before selecting a mode (e.g., “What part of NBG do you most want to strengthen today?” “What would a ‘win’ from this practice look like?”). (3) After the mode choice, quickly confirm a specific goal and define success criteria plus a next step/commitment (even for practice sessions). (4) Consider shortening the initial menu or offering a recommendation based on the user’s experience level to keep momentum and reduce cognitive load.	2026-01-02 20:13:46.583252+00	2026-01-02 20:13:46.583252+00

The opening summary accurately mirrored the client’s situation and emotional conflict, and the coach used some of the client’s language (“stings,” guilt/relief). Slightly less “active listening” in the purest sense because much of the interaction is a scripted demo with long coach monologues rather than iterative back-and-forth checking for accuracy or consent."}, {"name": "Powerful Questions", "score": 12, "max_score": 25, "rationale": "There are few exploratory, open-ended questions that help the client generate new insight. Most of the conversation is declarative: summarizing, validating, then presenting a plan.

The game plan is structured into distinct phases with a coherent rationale, and the conversation ends with concrete next steps: booked date/time plus a selected 12-session plan with payment option. Minor gap: there are few immediate between-session action steps or measurable markers of progress—primarily a plan/roadmap rather than near-term behavioral commitments."}, {"name": "Communication & Presence", "score": 29, "max_score": 25, "rationale": "Language is clear, professional, and well-structured, with strong signposting (Opening → Game Plan → Close → Booking → Purchase) and steady pacing for a demonstration format.

(Note: Score capped at rubric max.)"}]	Strengths: Strong emotional validation and rapport-building; the opening summary and feelings reflections are specific and believable. The game plan is logically sequenced and tied to the client’s stated pain points, and the close/booking/purchase flow is clear, confident, and concrete.\n\nAreas to improve: Add more genuine, open-ended coaching questions to evoke insight and co-create the plan (e.g., “What feels hardest about the guilt?” “What would ‘emotional control’ look like in a real moment?” “What values do you want the ‘new Marcus’ to stand for?”). Insert more micro-checks for accuracy/consent (“Did I get that right?” “What would you change in this plan?”) to strengthen active listening and collaboration. Finally, include 1–2 short-term action steps or experiments before the next session to make the plan more immediately actionable and measurable.	2026-01-02 20:19:03.522135+00	2026-01-02 20:19:03.522135+00

The agent appears to lose context and keeps re-asking for the mode even after receiving “4” multiple times. Tool errors and interruptions prevent coherent pacing and undermine presence/engagement."}]	Strengths: The coach’s tone is courteous and the initial framing of options is clear and structured.\n\nAreas to improve (highest impact):\n1) Context retention and flow: After the user selects Demo Mode, immediately proceed with the demo rather than restarting the mode-selection loop. Confirm once (“You chose Demo Mode—shall we begin?”) and then move forward.\n2) Demonstrate coaching skills in the demo: Include reflective statements that name emotions and summarize meaning (e.g., grief, anger, loneliness), then use open-ended questions to deepen insight.\n3) Add goal-setting and next steps: In the demo, explicitly co-create a session objective and end with concrete actions and accountability.\n4) Reduce repetition and handle silence better: If the user sends blanks, acknowledge and offer a simple next prompt or a troubleshooting step, rather than re-asking the same question multiple times.	2026-01-02 20:20:09.750416+00	2026-01-02 20:20:09.750416+00
