# Overview

NBG (Next Booking Guidance) is a session-closing framework where the coach secures ongoing work with the client at the end of a first session or meet-and-greet.

There are three steps of NBG:
- Future Work - Articulate what you'll work on together
- Booking - Schedule the next appointment  
- Purchase - Discuss coaching plan and investment

Expected sequence: Future Work → Booking → Purchase

Why this order?: The coach enrolls the client in a vision (Future Work), creates urgency by locking in the next session (Booking), then confirms the financial commitment (Purchase). This sequence builds momentum and makes each step feel natural rather than transactional.

### Coaching Session Structure

A coaching session typically follows this three-part structure:

1. GREETING & AGENDA SETTING (First few minutes)
- Welcome and rapport building
- Session overview: "Today we'll cover X, Y, Z"
- Context gathering
- **NOT part of NBG** - this is setup, not closing

2. COACHING CONTENT (Bulk of session)
- Discovery and exploration
- Problem-solving and strategizing
- Teaching and guidance
- Working through the client's situation
- **NOT part of NBG** - this is the actual coaching work

3. NBG (CLOSING FRAMEWORK) (Final 10-15 minutes)
- **Transition:** Coach wraps up coaching content and shifts to next steps
- **Future Work:** "Here's what we'll work on together..."
- **Booking:** "Let's get our next session scheduled..."
- **Purchase:** "Let me share the coaching plan options..."
- **THIS is NBG** - securing ongoing work after coaching is complete

# NBG Steps (Concise)

## Future Work

The Future Work component of NBG is a 3-step process:

1. “Opening”
    1. Provide a brief summary and analysis of what you’ve discussed in the session 
    2. An empathetic statement that demonstrates your understanding of:
        1. How the client feels 
        2. Why they feel that way 
    3. What their goal is and why they want it
    4. Then transition into Step 2 - “Game Plan” - by saying something to the effect of “Here’s what our work together will look like going forward…”


2. “Game Plan”
   1. Provide the client with 3 points of action for your work together going forward, starting with whatever is most immediately urgent for meeting their goal.  This is meant to show the client why there is continued value in having more sessions and inspire hope and confidence that they can achieve their goal through the methods you’re providing. 
   There should be some degree of organization between this 3 points like:
      1. First → Then → Last
      2. Short Term → Medium Term → Long Term
      3. Starting at Surface → Digging Deeper
      4. Immediate Picture → Medium Picture → Big Picture
         1. If your 3 points of action can’t be organized into a sequence, you can tie them together by sharing explaining how each of these points of action are complementary to their goal 

3. “Camaraderie Close”
   1. Reiterate your understanding of the importance of their goal
   2. “I’m here to support you every step of the way and I’m confident we can get there together.  How does that sound?”
   
---

## Booking (Concise)

The Booking component of NBG should assume the following flow, starting with a smooth transition after successful “Future Work” step:
“Great, let’s go ahead and get our next appointment on the books”
1. Recommend a broad time frame with a reason why that’s related to their goal and/or a specific Future Work point of action.  Ideally, the booking rationale will be tied to something specific to their ongoing situation, especially the most urgent first point of action, and not something too vague like “to keep momentum going”
2. Ask client which day of the week would work best within that time frame
3. Once ideal day is confirmed, share all available time slots you have that day 
4. Lock in the booking 


If there is resistance or hesitation to book, like a client saying they need to check their schedule or they’re not sure, the coach should always suggest booking a “placeholder” that can be canceled or rescheduled if necessary


Booking should always happen happen BEFORE purchase and AFTER future work 

---

## Purchase (Concise)

PURCHASE: Gold Standard (Short)
1. Smooth transition from Booking to Purchase
“Excellent—we’re all set for [DATE/TIME]. Our final step is choosing the Coaching Plan that fits you best.”
2. Recommend one specific plan (default: your largest plan unless it’s clearly not appropriate)
   * Why this plan fits their goals and aligns with the urgent Future Work items.
   * You don’t need a session-by-session outline for long plans; explain why the total number of sessions makes sense (e.g., room to handle twists/turns specific to their situation, like “as you navigate reconnection with Brandi”).
   * Recommend only one plan—do not run through your entire menu.
   3. Explain the financial value clearly
   * Share the hourly rate, not just the total price.
   * Compare that hourly to full-price single sessions so the savings are obvious.
   4. Mention any included perks
   * Examples: installment plan, text support between sessions, etc.
   5. When they confirm
   * Do not ask for permission to charge or send them to a menu.
   * Say: “Perfect—I’ll go ahead and run your card for that now.” Then process it.
---


Handling Price Hesitation:
If they hesitate on cost, always offer a workable path that preserves progress:
   * Session-by-session at the large-plan hourly rate
   * Smaller plan with an installment schedule
   * Apply the large-plan hourly rate to a smaller plan
Framing:
Acknowledge the concern and keep camaraderie front and center:
“I hear you on budget. I don’t want cost to be the only reason you can’t get the support you need. Here’s a way we can make this work…”

## Future Work (Detailed)

Future Work is a 3-step process that creates the foundation for retention by showing clients the clear path forward and building commitment to continue.

STEP 1: OPENING (Goal: Create fertile soil for your pitch to land)

The Opening has 4 required elements that must happen in order:
A. Summary & Analysis (30 seconds - 3 minutes)
* Briefly summarize what the client shared and what you uncovered
* Provide your analysis/thoughts on it
* Think of this like making coffee: the session is the whole process (grinding beans, boiling water), and this is serving them the cup of coffee it created
* Purpose: Alchemizes all session content into organized primary takeaways; creates smooth transition signaling you're wrapping up; gives your pitch a solid foundation
Examples:
* "So what we've uncovered today is that a lot of your anxiety around dating isn't really about the dates themselves - it's about this fear that you're going to lose yourself again like you did with Paul. That's such an important realization because it means the work isn't about becoming more confident on dates, it's about building the boundaries that let you stay connected to yourself even when you're falling for someone."
* "What I'm hearing from everything you've shared is that the issue with Jake isn't that he doesn't care - it's that his way of showing care doesn't match what you need. You're feeling neglected because you need verbal affirmation and quality time, but he's trying to show love through acts of service. That misalignment is creating this painful disconnect where you're both trying but neither of you feels seen."
B. Feelings Reflection
* Acknowledge how the client feels and why, using specific details they shared
* Go beyond generic ("I know you want to feel better") to specific ("I know how much not being where you want to be has been affecting your daily life - dreading that wedding next month, feeling uncomfortable in your clothes")
* Use their actual words, names, and situations to make it personal and real
* Purpose: Builds deep connection and rapport; shows your pitch is rooted in genuine understanding and care for THEM specifically
Examples:
* Generic (weak): "I know this relationship has been hard on you and you want things to get better."
* Specific (strong): "I know how exhausting it's been feeling like you're constantly walking on eggshells with him - second-guessing every text you send, rehearsing conversations in your head before you have them, that pit in your stomach every time his name pops up on your phone. That hypervigilance is draining, and I can see how much you just want to feel at ease and safe with him."
* Generic (weak): "I understand you're struggling with dating."
* Specific (strong): "I know how discouraging it's been putting yourself out there after being a hermit for so long - finally getting the courage to go on that date with Paul, feeling like things were going so well, and then having him ghost you out of nowhere. That kind of rejection after being vulnerable is crushing, and I completely understand why you're questioning whether it's even worth trying again."
C. Goal Reflection
* Name their specific goal and why it matters to them
* Keep it short and specific
* Purpose: Sets the scene that everything you're about to discuss is relevant to their goal; frames your Game Plan as deeply connected to what they care about
Examples:
* "I know how important it is for you to feel confident and secure in your relationship with Jake - to be able to communicate your needs without fear, to trust that he's committed, and to finally stop questioning whether you're enough."
* "You want to get to a place where you can date without losing yourself - where you can be open and vulnerable with someone while still maintaining your boundaries and sense of self. That's what this is all about."
* "Your goal is to move on from Paul for good - not just stop talking to him, but genuinely heal and be ready for something healthy when the right person comes along."
D. Transition to Game Plan
* Use confident, presumptive language: "Here's what our work together will look like going forward" or "Here's what we're going to work on..."
* NOT optional language like "If you want to keep working together..."
* Purpose: Smoothly guides client from reflection into planning; maintains momentum; signals leadership
Examples:
* Strong: "So here's what our work together will look like going forward..."
* Strong: "Here's what we're going to work on..."
* Strong: "So here's the plan for our work together..."
* Weak: "If you want to keep working together, we could work on..."
* Weak: "So if you're interested in continuing, maybe we could..."
Language Guidelines for Opening:
* Use THEIR language, not coaching jargon
* Reference specific names, events, and details they mentioned
* Keep it focused and clear - can be 2-3 minutes but avoid rambling
* Use "we" language (presumptive partnership)
---


STEP 2: GAME PLAN (Goal: Show compelling value of continued sessions)
Provide exactly 3 points of action for your work together going forward.
Structure Requirements:
* Start with the most immediately urgent/applicable action (what addresses their pressing concern RIGHT NOW)
* Organize the 3 points with clear relationship:
   * First → Then → Last (sequential steps)
   * Short Term → Medium Term → Long Term (timeline-based)
   * Surface → Digging Deeper (increasing depth)
   * Immediate → Medium → Big Picture (zooming out)
   * OR if no sequence fits, tie them together by explaining how each complements their goal in different ways
Examples of good organization:
Example 1 - Sequential (First → Then → Last): "First, we're going to establish the boundaries you need with Jake - what you'll tolerate and what you won't, and how to communicate those clearly without apologizing for them. Then, once those boundaries are in place, we'll work on rebuilding your confidence so you can show up authentically in the relationship without that constant fear of saying the wrong thing. And finally, we'll address the deeper attachment patterns that are driving this dynamic, so this doesn't just improve things with Jake but sets you up for healthier relationships going forward."
Example 2 - Timeline (Short → Medium → Long Term): "In the short term, we need to figure out your next move with Paul - whether you're going to reach out for closure or cut contact completely, and how to protect yourself emotionally either way. Medium term, we'll work on your approach to dating so you can get back out there without the same patterns repeating - finding that balance between being open and keeping your boundaries. And long term, we're going to address those abandonment wounds that keep coming up, so you can build the secure, healthy relationship you deserve."
Example 3 - Depth (Surface → Deeper): "We'll start by addressing the immediate communication issues - giving you scripts and strategies for the conversation you need to have with him this weekend. Then we'll dig deeper into why these situations feel so charged for you - unpacking the anxiety and fear that make it hard to speak up. And at the deepest level, we'll work on healing the core belief that your needs are too much, so you can advocate for yourself without guilt in every area of your life."
Content Requirements:
* Each point must be distinct and add unique value (no overlap/redundancy)
* Each point must clearly tie to their specific goal
* Use emotionally compelling language that brings each point to life
* Connect each point directly to what they're trying to accomplish
* Use "we" language and collaborative framing: "We'll work together on..." NOT "You'll need to work on..."
Language Guidelines:
* Speak in THEIR language, not jargon
* Use their actual names, events, and context: "as you reconnect with Brandi" NOT "your situation"
* Make it specific and tangible, not vague
Examples of weak vs. strong language:
Weak (flat/generic): "Work on confidence, figure out what to do next in your relationship, and set boundaries."
Strong (compelling/specific): "Build your confidence to the point that you can finally have that conversation with him without second-guessing yourself, find you the clarity you need to determine your next best steps in this relationship, and make sure the right boundaries are in place to keep you safe and protected along the way."
---


Weak (jargon-heavy): "We'll work on establishing healthy relational boundaries and developing your capacity for authentic self-expression."
Strong (their language): "We'll figure out how to tell him what you need without feeling guilty, and help you feel confident speaking up for yourself."
---


Weak (solo homework):
* "You'll need to work on setting boundaries"
* "You can start exploring what you want in a relationship"
* "You should figure out how to communicate your needs"
Strong (collaborative):
* "We'll work together on setting those boundaries so you feel protected"
* "We're going to explore what you really want in a relationship and get you that clarity"
* "We'll figure out how to communicate your needs in a way that feels authentic to you"
---


Weak (not tied to goal): "We'll work on boundaries, communication, and self-esteem."
Strong (tied to goal): "We'll establish the boundaries you need so you can finally feel safe with him, improve your communication so you're not constantly wondering if you said the wrong thing, and rebuild your self-esteem so you stop questioning whether you're enough - all in service of getting you to that place of confidence and security in your relationship that you're looking for."
Why 3 points?
* Shows scope, depth, and real process ahead
* Memorable and manageable (not overwhelming)
* Demonstrates substantive value of continued sessions
---


### Camarederie Close (Detailed)

Goal: Seal emotional connection and get buy-in

Two required elements in order:

A. Reiterate Goal Importance
* Show YOU get THEM and what they want
* Reflect the specific emotional stakes and why this goal matters to them
* Purpose: Shows deep understanding; makes client feel seen; proves this isn't one-size-fits-all advice

Examples:
* Generic (weak): "I know this goal is really important to you and we're going to work hard on it."
* Specific (strong): "I know how much getting to a place where you feel confident and free in this relationship means to you - being able to show up as yourself without that constant anxiety, finally feeling like you're not walking on eggshells anymore. That matters, and it's absolutely achievable."
* Generic (weak): "I understand you want to move on from your ex."
* Specific (strong): "I know how important it is for you to finally break this cycle with Paul - to get to a place where you're not checking your phone hoping he texted, where you can see a photo of him without your stomach dropping, where you're genuinely excited about meeting someone new instead of just trying to distract yourself from missing him. You deserve that freedom and peace."

B. Supportive Partnership Statement + Buy-In Pause
* Express confidence in them and partnership
* "I'm here to support you every step of the way and I'm confident we can get there together. How does that sound?"
* The "How does that sound?" is critical - it's confident and casual, inviting confirmation without inviting lengthy discussion
* NOT "Do you think that would work?" or "What do you think of that plan?" (too tentative, invites debate)
* Purpose: Creates warmth and connection; gets verbal buy-in that naturally leads to booking; strengthens retention by making client feel close to you

Examples:
  * Strong: "I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident we can get there together. How does that sound?"
  * Strong: "I'm with you on this journey, and I know we can make this happen together. How does that sound?"
  * Strong: "You don't have to do this alone - I'm here with you, and I truly believe we can get you where you want to be. How does that sound?"
  * Weak: "Do you think that plan would work for you?"
  * Weak: "What do you think about all of that?"
  * Weak: "Does that make sense? Do you want to try that?"
---


CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:
1. Never skip any step - all 3 steps are required, in order
2. Specificity is key - use their names, situations, words throughout
3. "We" language - collaborative, presumptive partnership framing
4. Tie everything to their goal - constant connection to what they want
5. Clarity and brevity - focused and organized, not rambling
6. Emotionally compelling - bring the work to life, don't just list tasks
Business Impact: Future Work is where you convert a good session into actual retention. Without it, clients don't see why more sessions matter. With it done well, they're excited and committed to continue. This is your pitch - make it count.

## Future Work (Script)

### Opening

[Summary & Analysis]
"Alexia, so what we've uncovered today is really important. You came in feeling completely torn about Paul - part of you missing what you had, part of you knowing something was off about how he disappeared. But what became clear through our conversation is that this isn't really about whether Paul is a good guy or a bad guy. It's about this pattern where you blame yourself first, where you immediately go to 'what did I do wrong?' instead of 'wait, his behavior was actually pretty concerning.' That's the real issue we need to address."

[Feelings Reflection]
"And I know how exhausting that's been - spending the last few days racking your brain, wondering if you said too much, if you scared him off, replaying every conversation looking for your mistake. That hypervigilance is draining. Plus, you finally got the courage to come out of your hermit phase, you were feeling hopeful about Paul, and then to have him just vanish without explanation - that kind of rejection after being vulnerable is crushing. I completely understand why part of you just wants to retreat back into that hermit cave where at least you felt safe, even if you weren't happy."

[Goal Reflection]
"But I also know how important it is for you to not let this experience keep you from what you really want - which is to find a healthy, stable relationship where you feel secure and valued. You don't want to spend the next year as a hermit again. You want to be able to put yourself out there, be open with someone, and not lose yourself or your peace in the process. That's what we're working toward."

[Transition to Game Plan]
"So here's what our work together will look like going forward."

### Game Plan

[Point 1 - Immediate/Urgent]
"First, we need to figure out what you're going to do about Paul - whether you're reaching out to him for closure, reconnecting to see if there's something salvageable, or cutting contact completely and moving forward. Whatever we decide, we'll craft the exact message together so it protects your boundaries and your emotional safety. This needs to happen soon so you're not stuck in this limbo spending mental energy on him every day."

[Point 2 - Medium Term]
"Then, we're going to rebuild your approach to dating in a way that actually works for you. Not the hermit extreme, not the diving-in-headfirst extreme, but finding that middle ground where you can be open and brave while also pacing yourself and keeping proper boundaries. We'll figure out what red flags to watch for, how to trust your gut instead of second-guessing it, and how to date without burning out or losing yourself in someone new."

[Point 3 - Deeper/Root]
"And finally - and this is the piece that's going to change everything long-term - we're going to address those abandonment feelings that came up around your mom and how they're showing up in your dating life. Those feelings are driving this pattern of self-blame and making you feel like you have to be perfect or people will leave. We'll work through that so you can show up authentically in relationships without that constant fear, and so the next time something like this happens, you're not questioning yourself - you're trusting yourself."

### Camaraderie Close

[Reiterate Goal Importance]
"I know how much it matters to you to get to a place where you can date and build a relationship without this constant anxiety - where you can be yourself, speak your mind, and trust that the right person will stick around. Where you're not walking on eggshells or replaying conversations wondering if you said the wrong thing. You deserve to feel confident and free in a relationship, not exhausted and insecure. And that's absolutely achievable."

[Support Statement + Buy-In] 
"I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident we can get there together. How does that sound?"

---


WHY THIS WORKS:
* Summary/Analysis pulls together the session into one clear insight (self-blame pattern, not Paul's behavior)
* Feelings uses specific details (hermit cave, racking your brain, replaying conversations) so Alexia hears herself
* Goal names what she actually wants (healthy relationship, feeling secure) and why it matters (don't want another year hiding)
* Transition is confident and presumptive
* Point 1 addresses immediate concern (what to do about Paul right now)
* Point 2 addresses medium-term work (dating approach/balance)
* Point 3 addresses root cause (abandonment patterns)
* Organization is clear: immediate → medium → deeper
* Language is in her words (hermit, racking brain) not jargon
* All collaborative ("we'll figure out," "we're going to work")
* Camaraderie Close shows understanding of specific stakes and offers warm partnership
* Buy-in pause gets confirmation naturally
This flow creates momentum from session → pitch → booking because Alexia feels deeply understood, sees clear value in continuing, and is emotionally connected to her coach.


---

## Booking (Detailed)

Booking is the critical step where verbal commitment converts into concrete action. This must happen AFTER Future Work and BEFORE Purchase. The sequence is always: Future Work → Booking → Purchase.

WHY BOOKING COMES BEFORE PURCHASE:
* Booking creates commitment that makes purchasing much more likely
* Having a specific appointment anchored gives you leverage if pricing becomes an issue (e.g., waiving prepay, offering payment plans)
* Once someone has a time on their calendar, they've mentally committed to continuing - payment becomes a natural next step
* If you lead with price and someone gets scared off, it's much harder to get them to book even without payment
* Psychology: saying yes to a specific time = commitment to the work; asking for payment first = decision point that invites hesitation

---

THE BOOKING FLOW (5 STEPS)

STEP 1: Smooth Transition from Future Work

After the client responds positively to "How does that sound?" immediately bridge into booking with confident, warm language.
Required elements:
* Acknowledge their buy-in
* Use presumptive language (not asking permission)
* Use the client's name
* Transition clearly into booking
Examples:
* Strong: "Great, I'm looking forward to continuing our work together, Alexia. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books."
* Strong: "Perfect! I'm excited to work on this with you, Jake. Let's get our next appointment scheduled."
* Strong: "Wonderful - I'm really glad we're doing this together, Sarah. Let's lock in our next session."
* Weak: "So... do you want to book another session?"
* Weak: "Should we try to schedule something?"
* Weak: "Would you like to look at my calendar?"
Purpose: This transition keeps the conveyor belt moving smoothly from plan to action. There's almost a sleight of hand aspect - you're guiding them seamlessly through warmth and efficiency of language.

STEP 2: Recommend Broad Timeframe + Specific Rationale

Suggest a general window (e.g., "early next week," "within the next few days," "later this week") tied to a specific reason related to their goal or Future Work - ideally the most urgent first point of action.

Required elements:
* Broad timeframe (not a specific day/time yet)
* Specific rationale tied to their situation (NOT vague phrases)
* Connect to their actual circumstances, names, events

Examples:
Vague rationale (weak):
* "Let's book soon to keep momentum going"
* "I'd like to see you again while everything's fresh"
* "Let's get you in sometime next week"

Specific rationale (strong):
* "Let's get you in early next week so we can work on crafting that message to Paul while everything from today's conversation is still fresh and you're feeling clear about what you want to say."
* "I want to see you before the weekend so we can prep you for that conversation with Jake at his birthday party on Saturday - that way you'll feel confident and ready instead of anxious about it."
* "Let's meet within the next few days so we can finalize those boundaries before you see him at Thanksgiving dinner next Thursday. We don't want you walking into that situation unprepared."
* "I'd like to get you in mid-next week so we can review how those first few dating app conversations went and adjust your approach before you agree to any in-person dates."

Why specific rationale matters:
* Creates urgency without being pushy (there's a real reason timing matters)
* Shows you're thinking about their actual life and circumstances
* Makes the booking feel relevant and necessary, not arbitrary
* Clients are more likely to prioritize booking when they understand why NOW matters

STEP 3: Ask Which Day Works Best

Once you've proposed the timeframe, ask which specific day within that window works for them.

Examples:
* "Which day that week works best for you?"
* "What day would be ideal for you - Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday?"
* "Which of those days works better for your schedule?"

Purpose: This narrows from broad to specific in a way that's easy for the client to answer. They're not looking at your entire calendar trying to find a time - they're just picking a day within the window you suggested.

DO NOT:
* Jump straight to a specific day/time ("How about Tuesday at 2 PM?") - this creates unnecessary friction if that slot doesn't work
* This forces backtracking or playing "slot roulette" suggesting times until something sticks

STEP 4: Share All Available Slots for That Day

Once they've confirmed a preferred day, list all your available time slots for that specific day.
Examples:
* "Perfect - on Tuesday I have 10am, 2pm, and 5pm available. Which works best?"
* "Great! Wednesday I'm free at 11am, 1pm, 3pm, and 6pm. What's your preference?"
* "Excellent - for Thursday I have morning slots at 9am and 10:30am, or afternoon at 3pm and 4:30pm. Which time range works better for you?"
Purpose: Giving them all the options for that day keeps them saying "yes" step by step. They've already committed to the day - now they're just picking the time that fits their schedule.


STEP 5: Lock in the Booking

Once they've selected a time, confirm it confidently and lock it in.
Examples:
* "Perfect - I've got you locked in for Tuesday at 2pm."
* "Great! You're all set for Wednesday at 11am."
* "Excellent - Thursday at 3pm is yours."
Purpose: Confident confirmation reinforces that this is happening. No hedging, no asking if that's okay - you're simply confirming the decision they just made.

HANDLING HESITATION: The Placeholder Strategy

If the client expresses any hesitation ("I need to check my schedule," "I'm not sure what my week looks like," "Can I get back to you?"), immediately offer a placeholder booking.

The Placeholder Script: "I totally understand. Let's do this - let's just put something in the books since my schedule fills up quickly, and we can always move it if something comes up. That way we at least have something secured. [Proceed with timeframe/day/slots as normal]"

Alternative placeholder language:
* "No problem - let's pencil something in now and you can always adjust it later if needed."
* "That makes sense. How about we lock in a time now as a placeholder, and if you need to reschedule once you check your calendar, that's totally fine. At least we'll have something on the books."

Why placeholders work:
* Converts uncertainty into concrete action
* Preserves momentum (once session ends without a booking, follow-through drops dramatically)
* Clients are much more likely to keep or reschedule a booked appointment than to proactively reach out to book from scratch
* Reduces the mental burden on the client (easier to adjust an existing appointment than to initiate booking later)

If placeholder doesn't work, offer alternate: If they still hesitate after the placeholder offer, suggest a different day in the same timeframe: "No worries - would Thursday work better than Tuesday?" Keep offering alternatives within your recommended window until something sticks.

---

CRITICAL DON'TS:
❌ Don't send a calendar link
* Shifts effort to the client and dramatically increases drop-off
* Breaks the white glove concierge service experience
* Calendar links are for rescheduling or backup only - NOT the primary booking path
* If you're not actively booking them during the session, you've stopped coaching

❌ Don't ask if they want to book
* "Do you want to schedule another session?" invites hesitation
* You already got buy-in with "How does that sound?" - now you're just executing
* Use presumptive language: assume booking is happening

❌ Don't tell them to book with someone else
* "Monica can help you book" or "Check with my assistant" kills momentum
* YOU handle the booking - own the process start to finish

❌ Don't suggest specific day/time before narrowing from broad timeline
* Creates unnecessary friction and potential backtracking
* Always go: timeframe → day → slots on that day

❌ Don't skip booking entirely
* Letting clients "handle their own booking" significantly reduces retention
* Even after a great session, self-booking drops conversion dramatically
* Booking should feel like an extension of the coaching, not an administrative task

---

LANGUAGE GUIDELINES

Throughout booking, maintain:
* Confident, presumptive tone (not asking permission)
* Warm, supportive energy (not transactional)
* Efficient forward motion (keeps conveyor belt moving)
* "We" language where appropriate ("Let's get our next session scheduled")

---

WHY BOOKING MATTERS FOR RETENTION

This is where verbal interest converts to concrete commitment. Every moment of friction is an opportunity for the client to hesitate or bail. Your job is to make booking so smooth and effortless that saying yes is easier than saying no.

Business reality:
* No booking during session = extremely low odds of continuation
* Once the session ends and they're back in their life, inertia takes over
* Clients need you to guide them through this step just like you guided them through the session
* The white glove concierge approach - where they don't have to lift a finger - is what drives retention

Remember: If you fundamentally believe coaching will benefit this client (which you do), then doing everything possible to increase the likelihood of booking is actually serving them, not just serving your business.

## Booking (Script)

[After successful Future Work, client says "Yes, that sounds great"]

Coach: "Wonderful - I'm really excited to work on this with you, Alexia. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books. I'd like to get you in early next week, ideally Monday or Tuesday, so we can craft that message to Paul while everything from today is still fresh and you're feeling clear. Which of those days works better for you?"

Client: "Tuesday would be better."

oach: "Perfect! On Tuesday I have 10am, 1pm, and 4pm available. What works best for your schedule?"

Client: "1pm would be great."

Coach: "Excellent - you're all set for Tuesday at 1pm. I've got you locked in."
---


## Booking (Script - Hesitation)

[After successful Future Work, client says "Yes, that sounds good"]

Coach: "Great! I'm looking forward to continuing this work together, Marcus. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books. I'd like to see you within the next week so we can start working on those boundaries before your ex reaches out again. Which day next week works best for you?"

Client: "Um, I'm not sure... I need to check my work schedule."

Coach: "I totally understand. Let's do this - let's just put something in the books since my schedule fills up pretty quickly, and we can always move it if something comes up. That way we at least have something secured. How about we tentatively plan for Wednesday or Thursday? Which of those would generally work better for you?"

Client: "Wednesday is usually better."
Coach: "Perfect. On Wednesday I have 11am, 2pm, and 5pm. Let's pencil you in for one of those - which time range tends to work for you?"

Client: "2pm should work."

Coach: "Great - I've got you as a placeholder for Wednesday at 2pm. If you need to adjust it once you check your schedule, just let me know and we'll move it. But at least we have something locked in."

## Booking (Script)

[Context: Coach has just completed Future Work with Alexia about the Paul situation. Alexia responded "Yes, that sounds really good" to "How does that sound?"]

[Transition to Booking]
"Wonderful, Alexia - I'm really excited to dive into this work with you. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books."

[Broad Recommendation + Specific Rationale]
"I'd like to get you in early next week - ideally Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday - so we can work on crafting that message to Paul while everything from today's conversation is still fresh in your mind and you're feeling clear about what you want to say. The longer we wait, the more you might start second-guessing yourself, and I want to strike while you have this clarity."

[Ask Which Day]
"Which of those days works best for you?"

Client: "Um, probably Tuesday or Wednesday."

Coach: "Great - let's go with Tuesday then so we can get this sorted sooner rather than later."

Client: "Okay, Tuesday works."


[Share All Slots for That Day]
"Perfect! On Tuesday I have 10am, 1pm, and 4pm available. Which time works best for your schedule?"

Client: "1pm would be good."


[Lock In]
"Excellent - I've got you locked in for Tuesday at 1pm. Looking forward to it!"

---

## Booking (Script - Hesitation)
[Context: Coach has just completed Future Work and client responded "Yes, that sounds really good" to "How does that sound?" - during booking, client expresses concern around scheduling]

[Transition to Booking]
"That's great, Marcus - I'm really looking forward to working through this with you. Let's go ahead and get our next session scheduled."


[Broad Recommendation + Specific Rationale]
"I want to see you before the weekend so we can prep you for that conversation with Jake at his birthday party on Saturday. That way you'll walk in feeling confident and clear about your boundaries instead of anxious and winging it."

[Ask Which Day]
"So that means we need to meet either Thursday or Friday this week. Which works better for you?"

[Client expresses hesitation]
Client: "Oh, um... I'm not really sure. I need to check my work schedule - it's been crazy lately."

[Placeholder Strategy]
"I totally understand - schedules can be hectic. Let's do this: let's just put something in the books since my schedule fills up pretty quickly, and we can always move it if you need to once you check your calendar. That way we at least have something secured and you're not scrambling to find a slot later. Does Thursday or Friday generally work better for you?"

Client: "Thursday is usually better for me."

Coach: "Perfect! On Thursday I have 11am, 2pm, and 6pm available. Let's pencil you in for one of those - what time range typically works best?"

Client: "2pm should work."

[Lock In (with flexibility)]
"Great - I've got you down as a placeholder for Thursday at 2pm. If you check your schedule and need to adjust it, just shoot me a message and we'll move it around. But at least now we have you locked in and you don't have to worry about my schedule filling up before Saturday."

Client: "Okay, sounds good."

Coach: "Perfect! I'm looking forward to prepping you for that party. You're going to feel so much more confident going in."

### Booking (Script - Analysis)
Example 1 (No Hesitation):
* Smooth, warm transition acknowledges their buy-in
* Specific rationale tied to Paul and the clarity she has NOW
* Moves efficiently: timeframe → day → slots → locked
* Confident language throughout ("let's go ahead," "I've got you locked in")
* Maintains momentum from Future Work straight through to booking

Example 2 (With Hesitation):
* Same smooth transition
* Urgent, specific rationale tied to the party on Saturday
* When hesitation comes up, immediately offers placeholder without backing down
* Acknowledges their concern ("schedules can be hectic") while providing solution
* Reframes placeholder as beneficial for THEM ("you don't have to worry about my schedule filling up")
* Locks it in with flexibility ("we can always move it")
* Ends with reinforcement of value ("you're going to feel so much more confident")

Both examples demonstrate:
* White glove concierge service (coach handles everything)
* Presumptive, confident language
* Specific rationale (not vague "momentum" talk)
* Step-by-step narrowing (broad → day → time)
* No asking permission, no sending links, no outsourcing
* Warm but efficient - keeps that conveyor belt moving
This is how you convert a great pitch into an actual booked session that leads to retention!

---

## Purchase (Detailed)

Purchase is the final step where commitment converts to financial investment. This must happen AFTER Booking. The sequence is always: Future Work → Booking → Purchase.
WHY PURCHASE COMES AFTER BOOKING:
   * Booking creates commitment first - once they have an appointment on their calendar, they've mentally committed to continuing
   * Having the session locked in gives you leverage if pricing becomes an issue (can waive prepay, offer payment plans, etc.)
   * Once someone has said yes to a specific time, payment becomes a natural administrative step rather than a scary decision point
   * If you lead with price and someone gets scared off, it's much harder to get them to book - even for free
   * Psychology: time commitment first → payment feels like completion, not a separate decision

---

THE PURCHASE FLOW (5 STEPS)

STEP 1: Smooth Transition from Booking to Purchase

After locking in the booking, immediately bridge into Purchase with warm, confident language that frames this as a simple next step.

Required elements:
   * Acknowledge the confirmed booking (reinforce it's happening)
   * Use "Coaching Plan" language (not "payment" or "charge")
   * Frame as final step in a natural sequence
   * Keep it warm and presumptive
Examples:
   * Strong: "Excellent - we're all set for Tuesday at 1pm. Our final step is just to confirm your Coaching Plan, and then we'll be all set."
   * Strong: "Perfect! I've got you locked in for Wednesday at 2pm. Last thing we need to do is get your Coaching Plan sorted out."
   * Strong: "Great - Thursday at 11am is yours. Let's go ahead and confirm your Coaching Plan so you're all squared away."
   * Weak: "So... do you want to talk about pricing now?"
   * Weak: "Have you had a chance to look at my rates?"
   * Weak: "Should we discuss payment options?"
Purpose: This transition keeps the conveyor belt moving smoothly. You're maintaining that warmth and efficiency - this is just the natural next step, not an awkward money conversation.
---


STEP 2: Recommend ONE Specific Plan with Clear Rationale
Present a single plan recommendation (default to largest unless clearly inappropriate) with specific reasoning tied to their goal and Future Work.
Required elements:
   * Recommend only ONE plan (not a menu)
   * Default to largest plan unless it's clearly not the right fit
   * Tie recommendation directly to their specific goal and Future Work points
   * Use their actual names, situations, and context (not generic language)
   * Explain why the total number of sessions makes sense for THEIR situation
   * Use "we" language and collaborative framing
Why default to largest:
   * Clients are most likely to purchase coming out of a great session (peak buying energy)
   * Longer packages = more time to provide value and build rapport = higher long-term retention
   * Even if you're recommending the largest, you should still mention it exists and explain why it's right for them
   * If NOT recommending largest, explain why it's not the right fit - this builds rapport by showing thoughtful tailoring
Examples:
Strong recommendation (largest plan): "Based on everything we discussed today - figuring out what to do about Paul, rebuilding your dating approach so you can find that balance, and addressing those abandonment patterns that are driving all of this - I recommend our 20-session package. Here's why: each of those three areas needs real time and consistency to shift. We can't rush through the abandonment work, and as you start dating again, you're going to need support navigating the situations that come up - the moments when you're tempted to text Paul, when someone new triggers your anxiety, when you need to practice setting boundaries in real-time. The 20 sessions give us the runway to work through all three areas thoroughly without having to pick and choose what we skip. It ensures we can support you as things unfold, not just give you a game plan and hope it works out."
Strong recommendation (smaller plan with rationale): "Normally I'd recommend our 20-session package for the scope of work we discussed, but based on the fact that your main focus right now is just getting clarity on the Paul situation and getting back into dating - and you're not quite ready to dive into the deeper abandonment work yet - I think the 10-session package makes more sense for you. This gives us enough time to work through those first two pieces thoroughly, and if you decide later you want to tackle the deeper work, we can always add more sessions. I don't want to overwhelm you with more than you're ready for right now."
Weak (menu dump): "So we have a 5-session package, a 10-session package, and a 20-session package. Which one sounds good to you?"
Weak (not tied to their situation): "I recommend the 20-session package because it gives you the most value and you'll make the most progress with more sessions."
Weak (generic language): "The 20-session package will help you work through your situation and make progress on your goals."
---


STEP 3: Explain the Financial Value Clearly
Present the hourly rate and compare it to the single-session rate. Do NOT lead with total price unless specifically asked.
Required elements:
   * State the hourly rate
   * Compare to single-session full price
   * Make the savings obvious and easy to understand
   * Only mention total price if client specifically asks
Why focus on hourly rate, not total:
   * Many of your best, highest-value clients ($10k+ spent) would never have started if you'd led with "this will cost thousands of dollars"
   * They continued because the pacing was palatable - focused on per-session value, not cumulative total
   * This isn't misleading - you'll gladly share total if asked, but leading with it scares people off before they understand the value
   * Since you genuinely believe coaching is mutually beneficial, framing pricing in a way that makes people MORE likely to continue is actually serving them, not a disservice
Examples:
Strong (hourly focus with comparison): "With the 20-session package, sessions come out to $120 per hour, compared to $180 for single sessions - so you're saving $60 every session. That's a third off."
Strong (emphasizing savings): "This package brings your rate down to $100 per hour instead of the $150 single-session rate. Over 10 sessions, that's $500 in savings."
If asked about total: "The total for the package is $X, which breaks down to $Y per session."
Weak (total only): "The 20-session package costs $2,400 total."
Weak (no comparison): "Sessions are $120 per hour with this package."
---


STEP 4: Mention Relevant Perks Briefly
After presenting value, briefly mention perks that support the decision. Lead with installments for largest package if applicable, then mention other service features.
Required elements:
   * Keep it brief - perks support, they don't sell
   * Mention installments first if available (biggest barrier-remover for largest package)
   * List other valuable features naturally (text support, 24/7 customer service, journal, homework database, etc.)
   * Don't specify whether features are "included" or universal - just state what's true about the service
   * Use perks to clear the runway, not as primary selling point
Examples:
Strong (installments + features): "This package also comes with an installment option, so instead of paying everything upfront, we can split it into three monthly payments. Plus you'll have text support between sessions so you can reach out when things come up, 24/7 customer service if you need to cancel or reschedule, and access to our on-site journal where I can send you prompts and exercises."
Strong (features only, no installments): "You'll also have text support between sessions for when situations come up in real-time, access to our homework database and journal for exercises between sessions, and 24/7 customer service if you ever need to adjust your schedule."
Weak (perks as primary pitch): "You should get this package because it's 20% off and includes free messaging!"
Purpose: Perks remove barriers and add value, but the strategic fit is what sells the plan. Don't lead with perks - use them to sweeten a recommendation that's already strong.
---


STEP 5: Confident Close and Processing
When client confirms the plan, use presumptive language to process payment immediately. Use "Coaching Plan" terminology, not transactional language.
Required elements:
   * Don't ask permission to charge
   * Use "Coaching Plan" language consistently
   * Process payment yourself during the session (don't send links)
   * Confident, smooth execution
Examples:
Strong:
   * "Perfect - I'll go ahead and process your Coaching Plan now."
   * "Great! Let me get your Coaching Plan set up."
   * "Excellent - I've got your Coaching Plan ready to process."
Weak:
   * "Can I run your card now?"
   * "Is it okay if I charge you?"
   * "Let me send you a payment link"
   * "Monica can help you with payment"
Why "Coaching Plan" language matters:
   * "Payment," "charge," "bill" are transactional and can create tension
   * "Coaching Plan" frames it as part of the ongoing coaching process, which it is
   * Consistent language maintains warmth and professionalism
   * Reduces money-related anxiety by keeping focus on the plan and work ahead
---


HANDLING PRICE HESITATION: Negotiation Strategy
When a client expresses price concern, this is NOT a dead end - it's an opportunity to find the right solution. Discounting and creative pricing is one of your most powerful retention levers.
CRITICAL BUSINESS CONTEXT:
Every coach should have a bottom line number - the lowest they're willing to go - and be willing to discount down to that number for the sake of closing the sale. Here's why:
   * Your rev share of something is better than your rev share of nothing
   * Sales volume impacts future client assignments - what you lose in hourly pay by discounting, you gain back in future opportunity
   * Price concerns are common and understandable - this is an expensive service, clients are average consumers
   * You need to find the right balance: show them WHY it's worth it while meeting them where they are
   * Full-price clients subsidize discounts - having some clients at full price allows you to offer discounts to those who need them
   * Only discount when needed - wait for actual pushback before offering alternatives
THE NEGOTIATION FLOW:
Step 1: Acknowledge the Concern Briefly validate without arguing or moving past it. This preserves camaraderie.
Examples:
   * "I hear you on budget - that makes total sense."
   * "I completely understand - this is an investment."
   * "I get it - I don't want cost to be the only reason you can't get the support you need."
DO NOT:
   * Skip acknowledgment and jump to solutions (makes them feel unheard)
   * Argue against their concern ("But it's really not that expensive when you think about it...")
   * Make them feel bad for bringing it up
---


Step 2: Offer ONE Alternative at a Time
Present a single workable solution, then pause. If that doesn't work, offer one different option.
Viable alternatives:
   1. Large-plan hourly rate, session-by-session: "Let's do this - I'll give you the $120/hour rate from the 20-session package, but you can book session-by-session so there's no big upfront cost. How does that sound?"
   2. Smaller plan with installments: "I can offer you the 10-session package with installments spread over three months - that brings it down to $400 per month. How does that sound?"
   3. Large-plan hourly on smaller plan: "I'll apply the discounted $120/hour rate from our larger package to the 5-session plan - that gets you started at $120 per session instead of $180. How does that sound?"
   4. Further discount if needed: "I can bring it down to $X per hour - that's my bottom line, but I want to make sure we can make this work for you. How does that sound?"
Required elements:
   * Present ONE option, then PAUSE (don't fill the silence)
   * Use confident, presumptive language ("Let's do this," "I'll offer you")
   * End with "How does that sound?" (not "Would that work?" or "Is that better?")
   * Wait for response before offering anything else
Why one at a time: Same principle as the initial pitch - multiple options create analysis paralysis and kill conversion. Guide them through one solution at a time.
---


Step 3: Stop Talking After the Offer
State your alternative and STOP. Let silence do its work. Don't fill it with more selling.
Good: "I hear you on budget. Let's do this - I'll give you the 10-session package at $100 per hour. How does that sound?" [PAUSE. WAIT.]
Bad: "I hear you on budget. Let's do this - I'll give you the 10-session package at $100 per hour, and that really is a great deal because you're getting so much value, plus the text support, and I really think this will help you with everything we talked about, and..." [keeps rambling, creates pressure]
Remember: Silence is part of the close. Give them space to think and decide.
---


CRITICAL DON'TS:
❌ Don't offer needless discounts
   * Only discount when there's actual price pushback
   * Full-price clients subsidize your ability to discount for those who need it
   * Rapport can be built without discounting
   * Wait for hesitation before offering alternatives
❌ Don't offer multiple alternatives at once
   * Creates confusion and analysis paralysis
   * Offer one, pause, wait for response
   * If needed, offer one different option
❌ Don't use transactional language
   * Say "Coaching Plan" not "payment," "charge," "bill"
   * Maintain warmth and professionalism throughout
❌ Don't ask permission to charge
   * Once they confirm, presume and process
   * "Perfect - I'll go ahead and process your Coaching Plan now"
   * NOT "Can I charge you?" or "Is it okay if I run your card?"
❌ Don't send payment links or outsource
   * YOU process the payment during the session
   * Links dramatically increase drop-off
   * This is the final piece of the white glove service
❌ Don't lead with total price
   * Focus on hourly rate and savings
   * Only mention total if specifically asked
   * Large totals scare people off before they understand value
❌ Don't lead with perks/discounts as primary reason
   * Strategic fit sells the plan
   * Perks and discounts sweeten it
   * Always anchor on goal alignment first
---


LANGUAGE GUIDELINES:
Throughout purchase, maintain:
   * "Coaching Plan" terminology (not payment language)
   * Confident, presumptive tone (not asking permission)
   * Warm, supportive energy (not transactional)
   * Specific rationale tied to their situation (not generic benefits)
   * One option at a time (linear decision-making)
---


WHY PURCHASE MATTERS FOR RETENTION:
This is where commitment converts to actual revenue and retained clients. If you've done Future Work and Booking well, Purchase should feel like a natural completion - not a hurdle.
Business reality:
   * Purchase is where your pitch ROI is realized
   * Every moment of friction can lose the sale
   * Strategic discounting converts hesitation into commitment
   * Your willingness to work with them on price shows you care about their success, not just the transaction
   * The smoother and more natural you make this step, the higher your conversion rate
Remember: If you fundamentally believe coaching will benefit this client (which you do), then doing everything possible to make purchase accessible is serving them, not just serving your business.

## Purchase (Script)

[Context: Coach has just locked in booking with Alexia for Tuesday at 1pm after successful Future Work about the Paul situation]

[Transition to Pricing]
"Excellent - we're all set for Tuesday at 1pm. Our final step is just to confirm your Coaching Plan, and then we'll be all set."

[Recommend One Specific Coaching Plan with Rationale]
"Based on everything we discussed today - figuring out what to do about Paul, rebuilding your dating approach so you can find that balance between being open and protecting yourself, and addressing those abandonment patterns that keep coming up - I recommend our 20-session package. Here's why: each of those three areas needs real time and consistency to shift. We can't rush the abandonment work, and as you start dating again, you're going to need support navigating the situations that come up in real-time - those moments when you're tempted to reach out to Paul, when someone new triggers that anxiety, when you need to practice holding your boundaries. The 20 sessions give us the runway to work through all three areas thoroughly and handle whatever twists come up along the way, rather than having to pick and choose what we skip."

[Explain Financial Value]
"With this package, sessions come out to $120 per hour, compared to $180 for single sessions - so you're saving $60 every session."

[Mention Relevant Perks]
"This package also comes with an installment option, so instead of paying everything upfront, we can split it into three monthly payments of $800. Plus you'll have text support between sessions so you can reach out when things come up, 24/7 customer service if you need to cancel or reschedule, and access to our on-site journal where I can send you prompts and exercises."

[Client confirms]
Client: "Okay, that sounds good."

[Confident Close]
"Perfect - I'll go ahead and process your Coaching Plan now."

[Coach processes payment]

"Great! You're all set. I'm really looking forward to our session on Tuesday, Alexia. We're going to figure this out together."

## Purchase (Script - Hesitation)

[Context: Coach has just locked in booking with Alexia for Tuesday at 1pm after successful Future Work about the Paul situation - Alexia expresses concern about price]


[Transition to Pricing]
"Perfect - Thursday at 2pm is yours. Let's go ahead and confirm your Coaching Plan so you're all squared away."


[Recommend One Specific Coaching Plan with Rationale]
"Based on what we discussed - working through your decision about reaching back out to Jake, rebuilding your communication confidence, and addressing that pattern of self-blame that keeps you stuck - I recommend our 20-session package. Here's why: you need time to practice these new skills and get support as real situations come up with Jake. We can't just talk about boundaries in theory - you need coaching in the moments when you're actually facing the decision to speak up or stay quiet. The 20 sessions give us that ongoing support as things unfold in your relationship, not just a game plan you're left to execute on your own."

[Explain Financial Value]
"With this package, sessions come out to $110 per hour instead of $180 for single sessions - so you're saving $70 every time we meet."

[Mention Relevant Perks]
"This package also includes installment payments, so we can split it into three monthly payments instead of one big charge upfront. Plus you get text support between sessions, access to our journal and homework tools, and 24/7 customer service."

[Client expresses hesitation]
Client: "That's... that's a lot. I wasn't expecting it to be that much."


[Acknowledge Concern]
"I hear you on budget - that makes total sense. I don't want cost to be the only reason you can't get the support you need."

[Offer First Alternative]
"Let's do this - I'll give you the 10-session package at the same $110/hour rate from the larger package. That gets you started with a smaller commitment but still gives us real time to work through the Jake situation and start building those communication skills. How does that sound?"

[Coach Pauses and Waits for Response]

Client: "That's still more than I was hoping to spend right now."

[Offer Second Alternative]
"I understand. Here's what I can do - I'll offer you the $110/hour rate but you can book session-by-session instead of committing to a full package upfront. That way there's no big cost right now, you just pay $110 each time we meet. How does that sound?"

[Coach Pauses and Waits for Response]

Client: "Okay, yeah, that would work better for me."

[Confident Close]
"Perfect - I'll go ahead and process your Coaching Plan for our first session on Thursday."

[Coach processes payment]

"Great! You're all set for Thursday at 2pm. I'm really looking forward to working with you, Marcus. We're going to get you feeling confident in these conversations with Jake."

# Mistakes & Lessons

## Future Work

---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Opening
Mistake: Summary/Analysis Missing

  Gold Standard: Begin Future Work with a brief summary and analysis of what was discussed in the session. This is the first step before moving into your feelings reflection and game plan.

  What happened: You jumped into next steps without first distilling what the client shared and what you uncovered. Throughout the session, there are lots of details and insights floating around - and they stay scattered until you gather them up and present them in an organized way.

  Going forward: Here's the thing - when you take even 20 seconds to summarize what the client shared, what you uncovered, and your thoughts on it, you're basically creating the perfect setup for everything that follows. Think of it like making coffee: the whole session is grinding beans, boiling water, all the process stuff - and this summary is you serving them that beautiful cup of coffee it all created. This step pulls everything together and creates real momentum as you transition into wrapping up the session. It shows you were tracking everything, and it gives your upcoming pitch the solid foundation it needs to really land. You've got this!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Opening
Mistake: Feelings Reflection Missing

  Gold Standard: Include a brief reflection of how the client feels and why, using specific details they've shared to demonstrate deep understanding of their experience.

  What happened: You moved into your recommendations without pausing to acknowledge how the client is really feeling or what they're going through emotionally. This was your golden opportunity to deepen that connection before the pitch!

  Going forward: This is where the magic happens! When you reflect back their feelings with specificity, clients feel genuinely seen - and that's when trust really builds. Instead of generic stuff like "I know you want to feel better," try something like "I know how much not being where you want to be has been affecting your daily life - feeling uncomfortable in your clothes, dreading that wedding next month." Using their actual words and situations makes it real and personal. This isn't just good coaching technique - it's showing them you truly get it and care about what they're going through. That connection is what makes clients feel confident following your lead. You're building something meaningful here!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Opening
Mistake: Goal Reflection Missing

  Gold Standard: Include a reflection of the client's goal and why it matters to them.

  What happened: You didn't name the client's goal or what's driving them. Without this piece, your Game Plan can feel a bit disconnected from what they're actually working toward.

  Going forward: Here's your chance to remind them what this is all about! When you name their goal and why it matters to them, you're essentially saying "I see where you're headed, and everything I'm about to suggest is designed to get you there." It frames your whole plan as deeply relevant to what they care about. Keep it short and specific - this simple step ties everything together and shows them you're on the same page about what success looks like. It's a game-changer!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Opening to Game Plan Transition
Mistake: Missing Transition

  Gold Standard: Use a clear transition like "Here's what our work together will look like going forward" to bridge from the Opening into the Game Plan.

  What happened: You went straight into the Game Plan without that bridging line, so the shift from reflection to planning felt a little sudden.

  Going forward: This is such an easy win! One sentence like "Here's what our work together will look like going forward" does so much heavy lifting. It signals leadership, creates structure, and smoothly guides the client into the next phase - like you're putting your arm around them and walking forward together. It makes the whole conversation flow naturally and shows you've got a clear path forward. Just add this line and watch how much smoother everything feels!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Opening to Game Plan Transition
Mistake: Weak/Hesitant Language

  Gold Standard: Transition from Opening to Game Plan with confident, presumptive language like "Here's what we're going to work on..." (not optional or hesitant phrasing).

  What happened: You used phrases like "If you want to keep working together..." instead of more confident language. This can accidentally create hesitation where you want momentum!

  Going forward: You're the expert here, and confident language reflects that! Instead of "If you want to..." try "Here's what we're going to work on..." It's warm and pressure-free, but it keeps the energy moving forward. Think of it like this - when you use presumptive language, you're helping reduce that internal "should I / shouldn't I?" friction for the client. You're making it easier for them to say yes to themselves and to the work. It's not pushy - it's being a steady, confident guide. You've got the skills and the plan - let your language reflect that!

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Opening
Mistake: Generic/Templated Opening
  
  Gold Standard: Use plain, client-specific language that reflects their actual experience - reference concrete details they shared.

  What happened: Your summary and empathy lines were too generic and could have applied to anyone. Without specific details, it felt impersonal and weakened the connection.

  Going forward: This is where specificity becomes your superpower! When you reference one or two concrete details - like names they mentioned, specific events, or even phrases they used - clients hear themselves in your words. That's what makes the pitch feel tailored to them, not like a template you're running through.

  For example, instead of "I know this relationship has been hard," try "I know how difficult it's been since that fight with Jake last Tuesday - feeling like you're walking on eggshells every time you try to bring up your needs."

  See the difference? The specific details create connection and show you were really listening. And here's the business impact: when clients feel like you truly get their unique situation, they're far more likely to want to continue working with you. Generic feels forgettable. Specific builds loyalty.

  Keep it simple and concrete - just weave in those details naturally. It makes all the difference in how your Opening lands and sets up everything that follows!

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Opening
Mistake: Overly Long/Rambling Opening

  Gold Standard: Keep the Opening brief and focused: summary → feelings/goal → transition. Aim for clarity and conciseness (2-3 minutes max).

  What happened: You lingered too long in the recap or emotional reflection, and the pitch lost pace and clarity. When the Opening rambles, clients lose attention and interest.

  Going forward: Brevity is the soul of wit! The Opening should be clear and punchy - hit your summary, acknowledge feelings/goal, then smoothly transition to the Game Plan. You can absolutely take 2-3 minutes to do this well, but keep it focused and organized.

  Here's what happens when it's too long and rambling: clients stop tracking. Their attention fades, they lose the thread of what you're saying, and by the time you get to your Game Plan, the energy is gone. That directly impacts whether they feel excited about continuing.

  Think of the Opening as setting the stage, not telling the whole story. You're creating the foundation for your pitch - making them feel understood and clear about where you're headed. Save the depth and detail for your Game Plan where you'll walk through the actual work together.

  Keep it tight, keep it clear, and watch how much better your pitch lands. Clarity = engagement = retention!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Opening
Mistake: Skipped the Opening

  Gold Standard: Do all Opening elements: brief summary/analysis, feelings reflection, goal reflection, and confident transition into the Game Plan.

  What happened: You jumped straight into the Game Plan without laying the groundwork first. The pitch probably felt a little disconnected as a result.

  Going forward: The Opening is your secret weapon! It creates the most fertile soil for your pitch to really take root. Even just 20 seconds of summary + feelings + goal reflection completely transforms how your Game Plan lands. It's the difference between "here's some stuff you should do" and "here's exactly what we're going to accomplish together based on everything we just talked about." That foundation makes your recommendations feel connected, personal, and exciting. Don't skip this step - it's where you set yourself (and your client) up for success. You're doing great work, and this piece helps them really feel that!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Game Plan
Mistake: Emotionally Flat Language

  Gold Standard: Describe the plan in language that builds hope, confidence, and clarity about achieving the goal. Bring each point to life by tying it directly to what the client wants to accomplish.

  What happened: Your plan was clear and made sense, but it could have been more inspiring! The language didn't quite capture the possibility and momentum of what you're building together.

  Going forward: This is where you get to paint the picture of what's possible!

  Before (flat): "Work on confidence, figure out what to do next in your relationship, and set boundaries."

  After (brings it to life): "Build your confidence to the point that you can finally have that conversation with him without second-guessing yourself, find you the clarity you need to determine your next best steps in this relationship, and make sure the right boundaries are in place to keep you safe and protected along the way."

  See how the second version makes it real and exciting? Connect each point directly to their goal using clear, purposeful language. This helps clients genuinely feel the value of the work ahead and gets them energized about what you're going to accomplish together. You're helping them see the path forward - make it vivid!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Game Plan
Mistake: Less Than 3 Points of Action

  Gold Standard: Provide three points of action for future work together, organized in a clear sequence or structure.

  What happened: You only offered one or two future priorities. The plan felt a bit thin, and it didn't fully showcase the scope and depth of what you'll accomplish together.

  Going forward: Always aim for three clear points of action! Each point adds structure and momentum, showing there's a real process ahead with depth and direction. This helps clients see the full value of continued sessions.

  Here's the key - organize your three points so they flow naturally. You can structure them as:
  - First → Then → Last (sequential steps)
  - Short Term → Medium Term → Long Term (timeline-based)
  - Surface → Digging Deeper (increasing depth)
  - Immediate Picture → Medium Picture → Big Picture (zooming out)

  Or if your three points don't fit a sequence, tie them together by explaining how each one complements their goal in different ways.

  The three-point structure isn't arbitrary - it shows clients there's real substance to the work ahead. You've got plenty to offer, so build the plan to its full weight and let them see everything you're going to accomplish together!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Game Plan
Mistake: More Than 3 Points of Action

  Gold Standard: Provide three points of action for future work together - no more, no less.

  What happened: You presented 4 or more items instead of a focused three. This created overload and made the plan feel scattered or hard to remember.

  Going forward: Three is the magic number! It's memorable, it signals structured progress, and it feels manageable to clients. When you go beyond three points, you risk overwhelming them - and an overwhelmed client is less likely to commit.

  Here's the key: prioritize. Choose the most important three points that will move them toward their goal, and table the rest for later sessions. A tight three-point structure sells clarity and direction, which is exactly what drives retention.

  Think about it from a business perspective - clients buy when they can clearly see and understand the path forward. Too many points muddy that clarity. Three focused, well-organized points show intentional leadership and make your pitch feel solid and achievable.

  Keep it tight, keep it to three, and watch how much more compelling your Game Plan becomes!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Game Plan
Mistake: Not Starting with Most Urgently Needed

  Gold Standard: Begin with the most urgent step needed to accomplish the goal - the thing that addresses their immediate concern.

  What happened: You opened with a lower-priority or big-picture item while the more pressing issue came later in the plan. This makes the plan less compelling right out of the gate.

  Going forward: Lead with what's most immediately applicable - the thing they can sink their teeth into right now! Here's why this matters: clients are more likely to feel excited about continuing if your first action point directly addresses their immediate concern.

  For example, if someone is trying to move on from an ex they keep talking to, big-picture work like "finding closure" or "healing" might be important, but it doesn't feel as urgent or actionable. What lands better? Something immediate like "discussing the boundaries that need to be set in place to actually protect your recovery going forward." That's tangible, it's now, and it speaks directly to what they're dealing with today.

  Starting with the most urgent priority isn't just good structure - it's what makes clients think "Yes, that's exactly what I need help with right now." It makes them want to come back. You know what they need - make sure your first point reflects that and watch how much stronger your pitch becomes!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Game Plan
Mistake: No Organization/Sequence/Correlation

  Gold Standard: Organize the three points so they have a clear relationship to each other (e.g., short → medium → long term; surface → deeper; or show how they complement each other thematically).

  What happened: Your points were presented without a clear order or relationship to each other. The plan felt more like a random list than a cohesive strategy.

  Going forward: Organization is what turns a list into an actual plan - and that's what drives retention! When clients can see how the steps relate to each other and how they're all working in service of their goal, they're much more likely to commit to the work ahead.

  Choose a simple organizing pattern: First → Then → Last, Short Term → Medium Term → Long Term, Surface → Digging Deeper, or Immediate → Medium → Big Picture. If your points don't fit a sequence, tie them together by explaining how each one supports their goal in complementary ways.

  Here's the business impact: clients buy when they understand the plan. A clear structure shows intentional thinking and helps them visualize the path forward. It makes the work feel concrete and achievable, not vague or overwhelming. That clarity = confidence = retention. Make the organization obvious and watch how much more compelling your pitch becomes!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Game Plan
Mistake: Redundant/Overlapping Points

  Gold Standard: Each point should be distinct and add unique value to the plan.

  What happened: Two or more of your points were essentially saying the same thing with different wording. This made the plan feel padded or shallow instead of substantive.

  Going forward: Make sure each of your three points advances the work in a genuinely different way. When points overlap or repeat, clients can sense it - and it makes your pitch feel weaker. Instead of seeing breadth and progression in the work ahead, they see filler.

  Here's the fix: consolidate overlapping ideas into one stronger point. Then find a distinct third point that adds real value. Each point should clearly contribute something unique to achieving their goal.

  This matters for retention because clients are evaluating whether continued sessions are worth it. If your three points feel like padding rather than a robust plan with real depth, the perceived value drops - and so does their likelihood of booking again.

  Give them three genuinely different angles of attack on their goal. Show them the breadth of what you're going to work on together. That's what builds confidence and keeps them coming back!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Game Plan
Mistake: Points Don't Tie to the Goal

  Gold Standard: Each point should clearly support the client's stated goal.

  What happened: Your steps weren't clearly connected to what the client is trying to achieve. The plan felt a bit generic or misaligned with what's actually driving them.

  Going forward: Here's the retention key - clients have a specific goal and a specific motivating force behind it. If your pitch misses that force, they won't be interested in continuing. Simple as that.

  Aim every point directly at their goal. If a step doesn't clearly move them toward what they want, either cut it or reframe it so the connection is obvious. When clients can see "oh, this is exactly what I need to get where I want to go," that's when they buy in.

  Clear goal alignment proves you're listening and tailoring the work specifically to them. It builds trust in both the plan and your leadership. But more importantly - it's what makes them want to come back. Keep the focus tight on what they actually care about, and you'll see the difference in your retention. You've got this!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Game Plan
Mistake: Unclear/Jargon-Heavy Language

  Gold Standard: Use clear, plain language for each point - speak in THEIR language, not coaching jargon.

  What happened: You relied on vague terms or internal jargon that the client wouldn't naturally use. When clients can't easily visualize the work, their enthusiasm fades and they're less likely to commit.

  Going forward: Rewrite each point so a friend could explain it back to them. Use words and phrases they actually use, not coaching terminology. Plain language beats clever phrasing every single time.

  Example:
  - Jargon-heavy: "We'll work on establishing healthy relational boundaries and developing your capacity for authentic self-expression."
  - Their language: "We'll figure out how to tell him what you need without feeling guilty, and help you feel confident speaking up for yourself."

  See the difference? The second version uses language the client would actually say. It's clear, concrete, and they can immediately picture what you're talking about.

  Here's the retention piece: when clients clearly understand the plan, they feel confident about it. Confusion kills commitment. If they leave thinking "I'm not totally sure what we're doing but it sounds... professional?" you've lost them. Make it crystal clear, make it their words, and watch your retention climb!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Game Plan
Mistake: "Solo Homework" Framing (Not "Work Together")

  Gold Standard: Provide three points of action for your work together going forward - use "we" language and make it presumptive.

  What happened: Your points sounded like the client would be doing them alone, without you. This reduces the sense that sessions are actually needed and directly weakens booking and purchase.

  Going forward: Partnership framing is everything! Use lots of "we" language and make it presumptive - "we'll" instead of "we can," for example. This shows you're in it together and makes continued sessions feel essential, not optional.

  Examples:
  Solo homework framing (weak):
  - "You'll need to work on setting boundaries"
  - "You can start exploring what you want in a relationship"
  - "You should figure out how to communicate your needs"

  Work together framing (strong):
  - "We'll work together on setting those boundaries so you feel protected"
  - "We're going to explore what you really want in a relationship and get you that clarity"
  - "We'll figure out how to communicate your needs in a way that feels authentic to you"

  See the difference? The second set makes it crystal clear that you're guiding and supporting each step. When clients hear "we'll," they understand that your continued involvement is part of the plan - and that's what drives retention. Make every point sound collaborative, and watch your booking rates improve!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Game Plan
Mistake: Skipped the Game Plan

  Gold Standard: Present three structured points of action for continued sessions.

  What happened: You didn't provide a structured set of priorities or next steps. Without this, clients can't see a clear vision for what comes next or why more sessions would matter.

  Going forward: The Game Plan is essential - it's literally what gives clients a reason to come back! Without it, momentum stops and retention drops. Even a straightforward three-point outline gives clarity and direction about where you're headed together.

  Here's the business reality: clients need to see the path forward to commit to it. When you skip the Game Plan, you're skipping the part that shows them why continued sessions will actually help them reach their goal. That's a direct hit to your retention.

  Make the plan explicit every time. Three clear, organized points that tie to their goal - that's what restores momentum and keeps them engaged. You've done the great work in the session, now seal the deal by showing them what's next. This is your retention moment - don't miss it!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Camaraderie Close
Mistake: No Reflection of Importance of Goal

  Gold Standard: Reiterate why the client's goal matters to them, showing that YOU get THEM and what they're working toward.

  What happened: You closed without acknowledging why the goal matters or what's at stake for them personally. The close felt a bit generic and missed the emotional connection.

  Going forward: This is the first step of your Camaraderie Close, and it's all about showing you truly understand the weight of what they're trying to accomplish. You're not some disconnected consultant giving one-size-fits-all advice - you GET them and what THEY want, and you understand how important this is to them specifically.

  Example: Instead of just saying "I know this goal is important to you," try something like: "I know how much getting to a place where you feel confident and free in this relationship means to you - being able to show up as yourself without that constant anxiety, finally feeling like you're not walking on eggshells anymore. That matters, and it's absolutely achievable."

  See the difference? You're reflecting back the specific emotional stakes and showing you understand their reality. This keeps the emotional thread alive and makes the close feel personal and connected. When clients feel that level of understanding, they trust you to guide them there. Keep it short and specific - but make sure they feel seen. This sets up the second step of your Camaraderie Close perfectly!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Camaraderie Close
Mistake: No Supportive/Camaraderie Statement

  Gold Standard: Include a supportive statement that reinforces partnership and belief in the client.

  What happened: You didn't affirm the client, express confidence in them, or convey that you're in this together. Without this, the relationship can feel a bit transactional or distant.

  Going forward: This is where you close the gap and make the client feel genuinely close to you! A simple statement like "I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident we can get there together" completely transforms how your plan lands. It turns direction into teamwork.

  Without this piece, clients can feel like they're facing the work alone - and that directly impacts whether they come back. But when they feel connected to you and believe you're truly invested in their success? That's when retention soars.

  Keep it sincere and concise. You don't need a long speech - just a clear message of partnership and belief in them. This is what turns a good pitch into one that makes clients think "I want to keep working with this person." It's the warmth and connection that seals the deal. Make them feel it!




---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: Camaraderie Close
Mistake: No Buy-In Pause

  Gold Standard: End with a soft check-in like "How does that sound?" to prompt engagement before moving to booking.

  What happened: You moved straight to scheduling without asking for their thoughts or agreement. The transition felt a bit rushed or one-sided.

  Going forward: This buy-in pause is all about momentum and flow! "How does that sound?" is the perfect phrase - it's confident and casual, inviting confirmation without opening the door to lengthy discussion that could stall the process.

  Compare it to something like "Do you think that would work?" or "What do you think of that plan?" - those questions invite debate or hesitation. "How does that sound?" is smooth and presumptive. It gives the client a moment to actively opt in and say yes to the plan, which naturally leads right into booking.

  Here's the retention piece: when clients verbally agree to the plan, they're mentally committing to the work ahead. That buy-in moment boosts follow-through. Without it, the shift to scheduling can feel abrupt and transactional, which can create friction right when you want momentum.

  Keep it simple - "How does that sound?" - and watch how naturally it bridges into the next steps. Don't skip this! It's a small phrase that makes a big difference in keeping things moving smoothly toward retention.

---

Step: Future Work
Sub-Step: N/A
Mistake: No Future Work At All

  Gold Standard: Always complete Future Work at the end of the session, which includes: Opening (summary, feelings reflection, goal reflection, transition), Game Plan (3 organized action points), and Camaraderie Close (goal importance + support statement + buy-in).

  What happened: You didn't do any Future Work - no pitch, no game plan, no articulation of what you'll work on together going forward. The session ended without painting any picture of the path ahead or why continued coaching matters.

  Going forward: Future Work is not optional - it's where you show clients the value of continued sessions and get them excited about what's possible. Without it, clients have no vision for what comes next, no understanding of how you'll help them achieve their goals, and no reason to believe more sessions will be valuable.

  Here's the retention reality: sessions without Future Work convert at close to zero. You've done great coaching, provided insight, built rapport - and then left all that value on the table by not showing them the path forward. It's like a personal trainer having a great workout with someone and then never mentioning "here's what we'll work on together to get you to your goal." They'll just... leave and probably not come back.

  Future Work is where verbal interest becomes commitment. It's where you alchemize everything from the session into a clear, compelling vision of your work together. It takes 3-5 minutes and can be the difference between a one-time session and a long-term client.

  Do it every time. Your retention depends on it, and more importantly, your clients need that clarity and direction to stay motivated and committed to their growth!

## Booking

Step: Booking
Sub-Step: Transition
Mistake: Lack of Smooth Transition from Future Work to Booking

  Gold Standard: Use a smooth, explicit bridge (e.g., "Great, I'm looking forward to continuing our work together, [NAME]. Let's go ahead and get our next session in the books.").

  What happened: You jumped into logistics without the bridging line, or the shift felt abrupt or awkward. The pivot wasn't smooth.

  Going forward: Say the bridge line every time! There's almost a sleight of hand aspect to this - you just want to keep the conveyor belt moving through warmth and efficiency of language. The transition signals the next phase and guides the client seamlessly from plan to action.

  Without this bridge, booking can feel jarring or like a sudden gear shift. The client might not track the change smoothly, making it easier for them to mentally pause or resist. But when you use that warm, confident transition line, they naturally flow right into scheduling with you.

  Think of it like this: you've just painted a compelling picture of your work together, they've bought in with "How does that sound?", and now you're simply guiding them to the next logical step. The bridge keeps it feeling natural and effortless.

  Keep it smooth with the bridge line, then proceed efficiently: timeframe → day → slots → lock. That's how you convert a great pitch into an actual booked session. This tiny piece of language makes a surprisingly big difference in your booking rates!




---

Step: Booking
Sub-Step: Language
Mistake: Differential/Weak Language

  Gold Standard: Use confident, presumptive language and lead the client into booking (e.g., "Great—let's go ahead and get our next session in the books.").

  What happened: You used weak or hesitant language like "Look at my calendar and book in whenever you want," "Do you want to book another session?," or "Monica can help you book." Instead of leading the booking yourself, you either asked if they wanted to book or outsourced it to someone else.

  Going forward: You need to lead the booking with clear, confident language! Presumptive phrasing reduces friction, maintains momentum, and keeps the client in a guided flow. When you ask "Do you want to book?" you're inviting hesitation and making them decide all over again. When you say "Go look at my calendar," you're shifting the burden to them and killing the momentum.

  Instead, assume the next session is happening and guide them through it: "Great—let's go ahead and get our next session in the books." Then propose a specific timeframe with rationale, and lock in a slot together. If there's pushback, offer a placeholder.

  Here's the retention reality: the moment you hand off the booking process or make it optional, you lose clients. Keep the decision simple, keep the momentum forward, and stay in the driver's seat. This is where your pitch converts into actual retention - don't fumble it at the finish line!




---

Step: Booking
Sub-Step: Timing Recommendation
Mistake: No Rationale Attached to Timing Recommendation

  Gold Standard: Tie your timing recommendation to the client's goal and/or a specific Future Work point—ideally the most urgent one.

  What happened: You proposed a timeframe without explaining why that timing supports the plan. The timing felt arbitrary, giving the client less reason to prioritize booking now.

  Going forward: Always connect the timeframe to the plan! A clear, specific rationale makes the timing feel relevant and necessary instead of random.

  For example: "Let's get you in early next week so we can work on drafting that message to him while everything's still fresh" or "I'd love to see you within the next few days so we can nail down those boundaries before the weekend when you're most likely to run into this situation again."

  See how that works? You're not just saying "book soon" - you're explaining why booking soon serves their goal. That one-line rationale makes the timing make sense and raises the perceived value of booking now versus later.

  Here's the retention impact: when clients understand why the timing matters, they're much more likely to actually follow through and book. Without that connection, it's easy for them to think "eh, I'll do it later" - and later often becomes never. Give them a reason to book now, and watch your conversion rates climb!




---

Step: Booking
Sub-Step: Timing Recommendation
Mistake: Vague Rationale Attached to Timing Recommendation

  Gold Standard: Use a specific reason tied to the goal or urgent action—not generic phrases.

  What happened: You used generic reasons like "to keep momentum going" or "while everything's fresh" instead of naming the concrete next action or need. This vague rationale didn't give the client a clear reason why the timing actually matters.

  Going forward: Ditch the vague phrases and get specific! Point to the exact next step the session will accomplish and why the timing supports it. Specific rationale drives relevance and creates urgency - vague rationale doesn't move decisions.

  Examples:
  Vague (weak):
  - "Let's book soon to keep the momentum going"
  - "I'd like to see you again while everything's fresh"

  Specific (strong):
  - "Let's get you in mid-next week so we can review those first messages before you send them"
  - "I want to see you before the weekend so we can prep you for that conversation with him on Saturday"
  - "Let's meet early next week to finalize your boundaries before you see him at the party on Thursday"

  See the difference? The specific version makes it crystal clear why the timing matters and what you'll accomplish together. That clarity creates urgency and makes delaying feel like a real loss.

  Here's the business impact: clients book when they see a concrete, compelling reason to book NOW. Vague timing recommendations make it easy to procrastinate. Make the reason obvious and practical, and watch your booking rates improve!




---

Step: Booking
Sub-Step: Scheduling Flow
Mistake: Suggesting a Specific Day/Time Before Narrowing from a Broad Timeline

  Gold Standard: Recommend a broad timeframe with a reason, then ask which day in that window works best, then offer all your slots for that day.

  What happened: You jumped straight to suggesting a specific day and time (like "How about Tuesday at 2 PM?") without first confirming a general window and preferred day. This created unnecessary friction in the booking process.

  Going forward: Start wide, then narrow! The broad-then-narrow flow is much easier for clients to navigate and keeps the process smooth. Here's why this matters: if you throw out a specific slot and it doesn't work, you lose momentum and have to backtrack to start more broadly anyway - or worse, you end up playing slot roulette, suggesting specific times until something sticks. That's exhausting for both of you and kills the energy.

  Instead, use this flow:
  1. Offer a timeframe tied to the plan ("Let's get you in within the next week so we can keep this momentum going")
  2. Ask which day in that range works best for them
  3. Then present all your available slots for that day

  This keeps the client saying "yes" step by step, reduces back-and-forth, and speeds up confirmation. Every smooth step forward increases the likelihood they actually book. Every moment of friction is a chance for them to hesitate or bail. Make it easy, make it flow, and watch your booking conversion improve!




---

Step: Booking
Sub-Step: Scheduling Flow
Mistake: Sending a Calendar Link Instead of Live Booking

  Gold Standard: Lead the client through booking in-session (timeframe → day → slots → lock).

  What happened: You directed the client to your calendar or an assistant instead of scheduling together during the session. This shifted the effort and responsibility to them.

  Going forward: This is actually an extension of the coaching itself! If you're not suggesting a time with a clear rationale, taking the steps to reduce friction, and actively increasing their likelihood of continuing sessions, then you've stopped coaching.

  Live booking preserves momentum and keeps ownership with the coach - which is exactly where it should be. When you send a calendar link, you're essentially saying "figure it out yourself," and that increases drop-off dramatically after the call.

  Here's the retention reality: every bit of friction you add reduces the chances they'll actually book. Asking them to click a link, review your calendar, find a time that works, and input their information - that's a lot of steps for someone to take after an emotionally intense session. And each step is a chance for them to get distracted, overwhelmed, or to simply not follow through.

  Own the booking process on the call. Give the timeframe with rationale, confirm which day works best, list your available slots for that day, and lock one in together. It's seamless, it's supportive, and it's what keeps clients coming back. Calendar links are for backups or rescheduling - not your primary booking path!




---

Step: Booking
Sub-Step: Handling Hesitation
Mistake: Not Responding to Hesitation Properly

  Gold Standard: If the client hesitates or needs to check their schedule, suggest a placeholder booking that can be canceled or rescheduled.

  What happened: You accepted the hesitation and either moved on without proposing a placeholder time, or dropped the booking flow entirely. This killed the momentum you'd built throughout the entire session.

  Going forward: When you hear hesitation, don't let it stop you! Immediately offer a placeholder: "Let's just put something in the books since my schedule fills quickly, so we know we at least have something - and we can always move it if needed." This keeps progress tangible while respecting their uncertainty.

  Here's why this matters so much for retention: a placeholder converts uncertainty into a concrete next step and preserves momentum. Without it, momentum is lost the second the session ends, follow-through drops dramatically, and the next session often never gets scheduled.

  Think about it - once they're off the call and back in their busy life, the likelihood of them proactively reaching out to book plummets. But if there's already something on the calendar? They're much more likely to keep it or at least engage to reschedule rather than disappearing entirely.

  If the first placeholder time doesn't work, offer an alternate one right away. Keep offering until something sticks. The key is maintaining that forward motion and getting something locked in before you end the session. This single move can be the difference between a returning client and one you never hear from again!




---

Step: Booking
Sub-Step: Sequence
Mistake: Booking Happening After Purchase

  Gold Standard: Booking happens before purchase and after Future Work. The sequence is: plan → book → pay.

  What happened: You took payment first and tried to schedule afterward. This broke the natural pitch flow and created unnecessary friction.

  Going forward: Keep the order tight: Future Work, then Booking, then Purchase. Here's why this sequence is so critical for retention:

  Booking creates commitment. When someone has a specific appointment on their calendar, they're much more likely to complete the purchase. That locked-in time anchors their commitment and reduces drop-off significantly.

  Plus, having the booking done first gives you leverage if pricing becomes an issue. You can offer solutions like waiving prepay since they're already booked in, or discuss payment plans while keeping that appointment secured. But if you lead with price and someone gets scared off? Good luck getting them to book after that. Once they've mentally checked out over cost, it's much harder to pull them back in - even for a free booking.

  The psychology is simple: once they've said yes to a specific time, they've already mentally committed to continuing. Payment becomes a natural next step rather than a scary decision point. Don't flip the sequence - it directly impacts your conversion rates and retention!




---

Step: Booking
Sub-Step: N/A
Mistake: Booking Not Happening at All

  Gold Standard: Always move to booking during the session, and if there's hesitation, offer a placeholder that can be changed.

  What happened: You ended the session without scheduling or holding a placeholder - likely telling the client to handle their own booking or check the calendar themselves.

  Going forward: This is one of the biggest retention killers! When you let clients handle their own booking, you're massively reducing the chances they'll actually follow through. Even after a great session, self-booking significantly decreases conversion.

  Here's the mindset shift: this should feel like a white glove concierge service where the client doesn't need to lift a finger. Handling booking for them reduces friction and ensures they remain moving forward at the right pace toward their goals. If we fundamentally believe that coaching will be good for the client - which we do - then we should do everything possible to increase the likelihood of booking.

  A confirmed (or placeholder) time converts intention into action and preserves momentum. If they're unsure about timing, suggest a placeholder and reassure them it's easy to move. This turns "maybe later" into a concrete next step.

  The reality is: no booking during the session = extremely low odds of continuation. Once that session ends and they're back in their life, inertia takes over. Don't let them drift away - secure that time before you wrap. Your retention depends on it!

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Transition
Mistake: No Transition Line

  Gold Standard: Smoothly bridge from Booking to Purchase (e.g., "Great, I've got you penciled in for DAY/TIME. Our final step is to choose your Coaching Plan and then we'll be all set.")

  What happened: You jumped into pricing or plan talk without an explicit bridge from Booking. The conversation felt abrupt or disjointed.

  Going forward: State a clear bridge after booking! One simple line - "We're set for [DAY/TIME]. Final step is to choose your Coaching Plan." - keeps momentum flowing and frames the discussion naturally.

  Without this transition, the shift from booking to payment can feel sudden and lose the warmth you've built throughout the entire session. You've been guiding them smoothly through Future Work and Booking with intentional language - don't drop that care now!

  Think of it like this: you're maintaining that conveyor belt we talked about earlier. The bridge line signals the next phase clearly while keeping the energy positive and forward-moving. It shows this is just the natural next step, not some awkward "now we talk about money" moment.

  This is especially important because purchase is often where clients feel the most potential friction. A smooth, warm transition helps them stay in that positive, committed mindset you've been cultivating. Keep it flowing, keep it natural, and watch how much easier the purchase conversation becomes!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Transition
Mistake: Weak/Differential Transition

  Gold Standard: Use confident, presumptive language when moving into Purchase.

  What happened: You used hesitant or optional phrasing to introduce the plan, which invited second-guessing and slowed commitment.

  Going forward: Be calm and presumptive when transitioning to purchase. Weak language reduces your authority and creates unnecessary friction right when you want smooth momentum.

  Examples of weak transitions:
  - "Have you had a chance to look at my rates?"
  - "Would you like to go over your options?"
  - "Do you want to talk about pricing?"
  - "Should we discuss the plans?"

  Strong, presumptive transition:
  - "Our final step is just to confirm your Coaching Plan. My recommendation is..."

  See the difference? The weak versions ask permission or check if they're ready, which prompts them to question whether they want to do this at all. The strong version assumes we're moving forward and positions you as the guide making a recommendation.

  Leadership matters here - clear direction keeps momentum. You've spent the entire session being a confident, supportive guide. Don't suddenly become uncertain when it comes to purchase. Guide them through this step just like you guided them through everything else. Avoid hedging, avoid asking if they want to hear options - just confidently present your recommendation. That's what converts!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Sequence
Mistake: Purchase Before Booking (Sequence Violation)

  Gold Standard: Future Work → Booking → Purchase. Always follow this sequence.

  What happened: You discussed or processed payment before confirming a session time. This broke the natural flow and created unnecessary risk.

  Going forward: Hold the sequence: plan, book, then Coaching Plan. Here's why this order is critical:

  Booking first anchors commitment in a scheduled time before you ever discuss payment. When someone has an appointment on their calendar, they've already mentally committed to continuing. Payment becomes the natural next step to confirm what's already decided.

  But when you flip it and go straight to purchase? You're asking them to commit financially before they've committed practically. That creates friction and increases drop-off risk - even after they've paid! They might complete the purchase in the moment but then never actually schedule, or they feel buyer's remorse because there's no concrete appointment anchoring their decision.

  After the time is set, present and finalize the plan. The booking makes the purchase feel like a simple administrative step rather than a big decision point. This sequence protects your retention at every stage.

  Keep the order tight every time: Future Work gets them excited, Booking gets them committed, Purchase seals the deal. Don't violate the sequence - it's designed to maximize conversion and minimize drop-off!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Plan Recommendation
Mistake: No Specific Plan Recommended

  Gold Standard: Recommend one specific plan (default to largest unless clearly not appropriate).

  What happened: You asked the client to choose from a menu or provided no clear recommendation. This created decision fatigue and reduced their confidence and momentum.

  Going forward: Recommend one plan confidently and explain why it fits their situation! Here's the critical insight: clients are unlikely to choose the biggest package if it's not made clear to them why it's right for their situation. They'll usually default to something smaller - or nothing at all.

  Clarity and leadership outperform open-ended choice every time. When you "menu dump" and say "here are your options, which one do you want?", you're actually making it harder for them to commit. Too many choices = decision fatigue = lower conversion.

  Instead, make the ask clear and singular. Look at their goal, look at the work you've outlined in your Game Plan, and recommend the plan that actually makes sense for what they're trying to accomplish. Then explain why: "Based on everything we've discussed and the work we need to do around [specific goals], I'd recommend the [X session package]. This gives us the time and consistency to really [accomplish specific outcome]."

  Leadership simplifies the decision. You're the expert - act like it! Make a clear recommendation and watch how much easier the purchase conversation becomes. Most clients actually want you to tell them what makes sense. Don't leave them hanging!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Plan Recommendation
Mistake: Multiple Plans Recommended at Once (Menu Dump)

  Gold Standard: Present one plan, not a list.

  What happened: You ran through several options at once instead of leading with a single clear recommendation. This created overwhelm and indecision.

  Going forward: Offer one plan at a time! Single-option framing keeps the path simple and conversion rates high. Here's how it works: present your recommended plan, explain why it fits their situation, pause for their response, and proceed from there. Only propose an alternative if there's resistance to your initial recommendation.

  The psychology here is straightforward: when you give someone three options, you're forcing them to make a comparison and a decision between multiple things. That's cognitive work, and cognitive work creates friction. But when you give them one clear recommendation with rationale, they only have to make one simple decision: yes or no to what you're suggesting.

  Keep the decision tree linear, not branching. "Based on what we discussed, I recommend the 10-session package because..." is much more effective than "We have a 5-session package, a 10-session package, and a 20-session package, which one sounds good to you?"

  If they say yes to your recommendation - great! If they express concern about cost or commitment, then you can offer a smaller alternative. But start with one strong recommendation and let that be the focus. This approach dramatically increases your purchase conversion rates!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Plan Recommendation
Mistake: Doesn't Default to Largest Plan When Appropriate

  Gold Standard: Default to the largest plan unless clearly not appropriate - and if you're not recommending it, explain why.

  What happened: You proposed a smaller plan without discussing the largest option or explaining why it wasn't the right fit.

  Going forward: Here's the business reality: clients are most likely to purchase when they're coming out of a great first session that's provided them with light and hope they maybe didn't think was possible. That's peak buying energy - and you're more likely to retain them long-term when they commit to a larger package upfront because you have more time to provide value and build rapport.

  Lead with the largest plan when it fits the work outlined in your Game Plan. Justify the runway in client-specific terms: "Based on everything we discussed - working on boundaries, rebuilding confidence, and navigating your next steps with him - I recommend the 20-session package. This gives us the time and consistency to really tackle all three areas without rushing."

  But here's the key: if you're NOT going to pitch the biggest package, you should still mention it and explain why it's not the right fit for them. "Normally I'd recommend our largest package, but based on [specific reason], I think the 10-session package makes more sense for you because..."

  This actually builds rapport because it shows you're not just arbitrarily trying to sell them the biggest package every time. Either way - whether you're pitching the largest or smallest package - the largest should still come up in the conversation. This demonstrates thoughtful recommendation rather than one-size-fits-all selling!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Rationale
Mistake: Rationale Not Tied to Goal/Future Work

  Gold Standard: Tie the recommendation to their goal and urgent Future Work items.

  What happened: You proposed a plan without connecting it to the client's goal and next steps. The recommendation felt generic and didn't show clear relevance to their specific situation.

  Going forward: Relevance drives buy-in - and here's the key: clients are unlikely to choose the biggest package if it's not made clear to them why it's right for their situation. They'll usually default to something smaller or nothing at all.

  Name the goal and the urgent work, then link the plan directly to both. One or two sentences is enough, but make it specific to them:

  Generic (weak): "I recommend the 20-session package."

  Tied to goal/Future Work (strong): "Based on what we discussed - figuring out your next steps with Paul, finding the right balance in dating, and addressing those abandonment feelings - I recommend the 20-session package. This gives us the runway to work through all three areas thoroughly so you can get to that place of confidence and clarity you're looking for."

  See the difference? The specifics prove you're tailoring the recommendation to their actual needs, not just trying to sell them something. Make the "why this plan" unmistakable by connecting it directly to what they told you they want to accomplish.

  When clients see that clear connection between the package and their goals, they understand the value and are much more likely to commit. Without it, perceived fit and urgency drop - and so does your conversion rate!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Rationale
Mistake: Vague Rationale

  Gold Standard: Use specific, situational reasons tied to their exact circumstances - not generic phrases.

  What happened: You used generic language that could apply to anyone, like "to keep momentum going" or "to make progress." The client couldn't see why this specific plan matters for their specific situation.

  Going forward: Replace generic phrasing with concrete, client-specific reasons! The client simply won't feel called to go for the package if it's not clear why it's right for THEM.

  Vague (doesn't work):
  - "The 20-session package will help you keep momentum going"
  - "This gives us time to make real progress"
  - "You'll get more value with more sessions"

  Specific (actually lands):
  - "The 20-session package gives us the runway to work through figuring out your boundaries with Jake, rebuilding your confidence for dating, and processing those abandonment patterns - all three pieces need time and consistency to really shift"
  - "With 10 sessions we can tackle the immediate Paul situation and your dating approach, but we won't have enough time to address the deeper abandonment work that's driving a lot of this"

  See the difference? Reference the exact work you'll tackle and why that work requires this particular package. Specifics move decisions; vagueness delays them or kills them entirely.

  Make the rationale tangible and personal. When clients see themselves and their specific goals reflected in your recommendation, they understand the fit. That's what converts - not generic benefits, but clear relevance to what they actually want to accomplish!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Rationale
Mistake: Not Using Language Tailored to Client's Situation

  Gold Standard: Make your rationale specific by using their actual names, events, and context (e.g., "as you reconnect with Brandi," not "your situation").

  What happened: You used generic, impersonal phrasing and avoided naming the client's specific context directly. The recommendation felt templated and engagement dropped.

  Going forward: Use the client's actual names, events, and details when explaining your recommendation! Personalization strengthens relevance and connection dramatically.

  Generic (feels templated):
  - "This package will help you work through your situation"
  - "We'll address your relationship challenges"
  - "You'll have time to figure out your next steps"

  Personalized (feels tailored):
  - "This package gives us the time to work through your decision about Paul, navigate your return to dating after being a hermit, and process those abandonment feelings that came up around your mom"
  - "We'll tackle that conversation you need to have with Jake at his birthday party next week, plus the bigger confidence work"
  - "This ensures we can support you through reconnecting with Brandi and setting boundaries with your sister before Thanksgiving"

  See the difference? Small details signal precision and show you're thinking about their specific path, not a generic one. When you reference their actual people, events, and circumstances, the fit feels unmistakably theirs.

  This level of personalization directly impacts purchase rates because it proves you were listening and that your recommendation is truly tailored to them. Make it feel personal - because it should be!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Value Positioning
Mistake: Perks/Discounting Positioned as the Core Reason

  Gold Standard: Lead with fit to goal and Future Work; perks and discounts are secondary supporting points.

  What happened: You emphasized the discount or perks over the strategic rationale for why this plan fits their needs. The plan felt like a promotion instead of a tailored recommendation.

  Going forward: Strategic fit sells the plan; perks and discounts just sweeten it. When you lead with "this package is 20% off" or "you get free messaging," you're positioning the plan as a deal rather than as the right solution for their specific goals.

  Anchor on strategic fit first: "Based on the work we need to do - figuring out your boundaries with Jake, rebuilding your dating confidence, and addressing those abandonment patterns - the 20-session package is what I recommend. It gives us the runway to tackle all three areas thoroughly." Then, if relevant, you can briefly mention perks: "Plus, this package includes unlimited messaging between sessions, which will be helpful as situations come up in real-time."

  See the order? The value logic should be about the work and why this package enables them to achieve their goal - not about the extras or savings. Perks support the recommendation, they never lead it.

  When you lead with perks, it actually undermines the perceived value of the coaching itself. But when you lead with strategic fit and add perks as a bonus? That's a recommendation that feels thoughtful and professional. Keep the focus on what matters most: their goals and the work required to get there!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Pricing
Mistake: Quotes Total Price Only

  Gold Standard: Share the hourly rate and compare it to the single-session full rate so the client can understand the discount and value. Only share the total price if specifically asked.

  What happened: You either led with the total price or omitted the hourly framing entirely. When you lead with a large total number, the price feels heavier and can scare clients away before they understand the value.

  Going forward: Focus on the hourly rate and make the savings obvious! State the hourly rate, then contrast it with the single-session rate: "With this package, sessions come out to $X per hour, compared to $Y for single sessions - so you're saving $Z per session."

  Here's why this framing matters: many of your best, highest-value clients who've spent $10k+ would never have started if you'd led with "this will cost you thousands of dollars." They continued because the pacing was palatable and manageable - they were focused on the immediate per-session cost and what they're getting for that, not the cumulative total.

  This isn't misleading - you'll gladly share the total if they ask! But since you genuinely believe coaching is mutually beneficial, framing pricing in a way that makes people more likely to continue is actually doing them a service, not a disservice. If you present pricing in a way that scares them off before they even start, you're preventing them from getting the help they need.

  Keep the focus on hourly value and immediate savings. Clear math reduces friction. Only mention the total price if the client specifically asks for it!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Pricing
Mistake: No Comparison to Single-Session Rate

  Gold Standard: Compare the plan's hourly rate to the full-price single-session rate.

  What happened: You quoted the price without providing any contrast or comparison. The client couldn't see the value or understand the magnitude of the savings, making them less likely to commit.

  Going forward: Add a simple comparison line every time: "With this package, sessions come out to $X per hour, versus $Y for single sessions." This creates an easy value anchor and frames the savings instantly.

  Here's why this matters: without the comparison, clients are just hearing a number in a vacuum. They don't have context for whether it's a good deal or not. But when you show them "you're paying $175/hour instead of $250/hour," suddenly they can see they're saving $60 per session. That's concrete value they can understand.

  The contrast reduces sticker shock because instead of thinking "that's expensive," they're thinking "that's a good deal compared to paying full price." The math does the selling for you - you just need to present it clearly.

  Make this comparison automatic in every purchase conversation. It's one sentence that significantly increases conversion by helping clients immediately understand the value they're getting. Don't skip this step!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Perks
Mistake: Doesn't Mention Relevant Perks

  Gold Standard: Briefly include relevant perks after presenting the strategic rationale and rate (e.g., installments, text support, 24/7 customer service).

  What happened: You failed to mention perks that could help remove barriers to yes or that fit the client's needs. Unnecessary objections may have remained as a result.

  Going forward: After you've anchored on strategic fit and shown the hourly rate comparison, briefly mention relevant perks that support their decision. For the largest package, the main perk is usually that it's the only one offering installment payments - which can be a huge barrier-remover for cost concerns.

  You can also mention other valuable features of the service: "It also comes with text support between sessions so you can reach out when things come up, 24/7 customer service if you need to cancel or reschedule, access to our on-site journal where I can send you prompts and exercises, our homework database..." These are all true features of the service that add value.

  Keep it short and relevant - don't list every single thing, just the ones that matter most for this client. Use perks to clear the runway and remove potential objections, but remember: perks support the decision, they don't sell on their own. Lead with strategic fit and value, then add perks as the finishing touch that makes saying yes even easier!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Closing
Mistake: Asking Permission to Charge

  Gold Standard: Upon confirmation, use presumptive language: "Perfect—I'll go ahead and run your card for that now."

  What happened: You asked for permission to charge after the client already agreed, saying something like "Can I run your card?" or "Is it okay if I charge you now?" This invited last-minute hesitation.

  Going forward: Use the standard close line once they confirm the plan. Don't reopen the decision! When a client says yes to the package, that's their agreement to purchase. Asking permission to charge after they've already agreed creates an unnecessary moment where they might second-guess or backpedal.

  Here's the flow: They confirm → You say "Perfect—I'll go ahead and add that to your account now" → You process the payment smoothly.

  The presumptive close maintains momentum and treats the charge as the natural next step, which it is. Confidence here prevents unnecessary friction at the finish line. You're not being pushy - they already said yes. You're simply completing the transaction efficiently.

  Think of it like the booking process: you don't ask "Do you want me to book you?" after they've agreed to a time - you just book them. Same principle applies here. Once they've confirmed the plan, charge smoothly and proceed. Keep that conveyor belt moving all the way through!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Closing
Mistake: Offloading Payment to Client

  Gold Standard: Coach processes payment directly during the session.

  What happened: You sent the client to a payment link or menu to handle checkout themselves, rather than processing it together on the call. The experience felt disjointed and impersonal.

  Going forward: Handle the charge yourself on the call! When you offload payment to the client, drop-off risk increases significantly. Even after a great session, great pitch, and confirmed booking, asking them to "go pay on your own" adds friction at the most critical moment.

  Keep control of the process. The smoother you make it, the higher the completion rate. Think about it: you've guided them through the entire session, through Future Work, through Booking, and through selecting their plan - why would you suddenly hand off the final step?

  This is an extension of that white glove concierge service we talked about in Booking. You're making it effortless for them to say yes and follow through. When you process the payment directly, there's no opportunity for them to get distracted, change their mind, or simply forget to complete it.

  Own the last mile. Stay on the call, process the payment together, and ensure the transaction is complete before you wrap. This final piece of ownership is what converts a verbal agreement into actual revenue and retained clients!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Language
Mistake: Non-Coaching Plan Language

  Gold Standard: Refer to payment as the "Coaching Plan" - not "payment," "charge," or other transactional terms.

  What happened: You used transactional language like "Let me process your payment" or "I'll charge your card now" instead of the standard "Coaching Plan" terminology. The tone shifted colder and the client may have tensed up.

  Going forward: This is an important language shift that keeps the entire purchase conversation feeling warm and professional. Instead of saying payment-focused words, use "Coaching Plan" consistently throughout.

  Transactional language (avoid):
  - "Let me process your payment"
  - "I'll charge your card"
  - "What's your payment method?"
  - "Let's handle the payment"

  Coaching Plan language (use this):
  - "Let's confirm your Coaching Plan"
  - "I'll go ahead and process your Coaching Plan now"
  - "Perfect - I've got your Coaching Plan set up"

  Why does this matter? When you use words like "payment" and "charge," it frames this step as a separate financial transaction - which can create tension. But "Coaching Plan" frames it as part of the ongoing coaching process, which it is! It's about the plan you're committing to together, not just a monetary exchange.

  Consistent language feels professional, maintains warmth, and reduces money-related tension. Keep to "Coaching Plan" phrasing throughout the entire purchase conversation. It supports trust and ease, and helps the client stay focused on the value and the work ahead rather than fixating on the transaction itself!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Handling Hesitation
Mistake: Doesn't Acknowledge the Concern

  Gold Standard: Briefly validate the concern before offering a solution or alternative path forward.

  What happened: You either moved past the concern without addressing it, or you argued against it. The client felt unheard and their resistance likely hardened.

  Going forward: Being able to negotiate effectively - not just fold at the first sign of price hesitation - is HUGE for retention! Price concerns are very common and completely understandable. This is an expensive service, our clients are average consumers, and we need to find the right balance of showing them WHY it's worth it while also meeting them where they are as much as possible.

  Start by naming the concern succinctly: "I hear you on budget - that makes total sense." This acknowledgment preserves camaraderie and shows respect. Then offer your best path forward, whether that's explaining value differently, offering a smaller package, or discussing flexible pricing options.

  Here's the critical business piece: discounting and creative pricing is one of the most powerful levers you can pull for retention. Every coach should have a bottom line number - the lowest they're willing to go - and be willing to discount down to that number for the sake of actually closing the sale. Your rev share percentage of something, even a discounted offer, is better than your percentage of nothing!

  Even if it's not the biggest win for you hourly, remember: these sales strengthen your overall numbers, which determine your eligibility for new clients to be assigned to you. What you may lose in hourly pay by discounting, you're gaining back in future opportunity.

  Keep it short, steady, and solution-oriented. Respect plus solution keeps progress intact and converts hesitation into commitment!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Handling Hesitation
Mistake: Offers Multiple Alternatives at Once

  Gold Standard: Present one alternative at a time, with a pause for response.

  What happened: You stacked several alternatives in one breath - presenting options A, B, and C simultaneously. This created analysis paralysis and stalled momentum.

  Going forward: This is the exact same principle as why we present one plan in the initial pitch instead of menu dumping! Linear choices reduce overload and indecision. When someone expresses price concern and you respond with "Well, we could do the smaller package, or I could offer a discount, or we could do installments, or..." you're forcing them to compare multiple options and make multiple decisions. That's cognitive work that kills conversion.

  Instead, offer one alternative and pause. Let them respond. If that doesn't work, present a different single option next. Keep the lane narrow and forward-moving.

  For example: "I hear you on budget. Let's do this - I'll offer you the 10-session package at a discounted rate of $X per hour. How does that sound?" Pause. Get their response. If they're still hesitant, then offer your next best alternative.

  Here's the critical business piece: discounting and creative pricing is one of the most powerful levers you can pull for retention. Every coach should have a bottom line number - the lowest they're willing to go - and be willing to discount down to that number for the sake of actually closing the sale. Your rev share percentage of something, even a discounted offer, is better than your percentage of nothing! Even if it's not the biggest win for you hourly, remember: these sales strengthen your overall numbers, which determine your eligibility for new clients to be assigned to you. What you may lose in hourly pay by discounting, you're gaining back in future opportunity.

  Guide them through one solution at a time using confident, presumptive language. Simplicity converts - complexity confuses and loses sales!

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Handling Hesitation
Mistake: No Viable Alternative Offered

  Gold Standard: Provide a workable path when price is a concern (e.g., large-plan hourly rate applied session-by-session; smaller plan with installments; large-plan hourly rate on smaller plan).

  What happened: You acknowledged the price concern but didn't present a solvable option. The client ended the call without moving forward - meaning you lost the sale entirely.

  Going forward: Always have one viable alternative ready! When a client expresses price hesitation, that's not a "no" - it's an opportunity to find the right solution. Present your alternative plainly and pause for response. If that doesn't work, offer one more option. Keep solutions practical and singular (one at a time, remember!).

  Examples of viable alternatives:
  - "Let's do this - I'll give you the large-plan hourly rate of $X, but you can book session-by-session so there's no big upfront cost. How does that sound?"
  - "I can offer you the 10-session package with installments spread over three months - that brings it down to $X per month. How does that sound?"
  - "I'll apply the discounted hourly rate from our larger package to the smaller 5-session plan - that gets you started at $X per session. How does that sound?"

  Here's the critical business piece: discounting and creative pricing is one of the most powerful levers you can pull for retention. Every coach should have a bottom line number - the lowest they're willing to go - and be willing to discount down to that number for the sake of actually closing the sale. Your rev share percentage of something, even a discounted offer, is better than your percentage of nothing! Even if it's not the biggest win for you hourly, remember: these sales strengthen your overall numbers, which determine your eligibility for new clients to be assigned to you. What you may lose in hourly pay by discounting, you're gaining back in future opportunity.

  Don't let price concerns end the conversation. A clear path preserves progress and converts hesitation into commitment!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Discounting
Mistake: Needless Discounting

  Gold Standard: Use structured alternatives only in response to actual pushback or price concern - don't offer discounts preemptively.

  What happened: You offered discounts without any price pushback from the client. This was an ad-hoc price drop that wasn't necessary for closing the sale.

  Going forward: While discounting is one of your most powerful retention levers, you should only use it when needed! Here's why: having some full-price clients essentially subsidizes your ability to offer more discounts to those who truly need them. If you discount everyone unnecessarily, you're hurting your overall earnings without gaining any additional retention benefit.

  Can offering an unprompted discount help build rapport? Sure. But rapport can be built without discounting - through great coaching, personalized attention, and genuine connection. Needless discounting is ultimately bad for business because you're leaving money on the table when the client was already ready to buy at full price.

  Only leverage discounts for retention and rapport if you strongly believe retention will not happen without doing so. Wait for actual price hesitation or concern before you start offering alternatives or discounts. If a client says "yes" to your initial recommendation at full price, take that win! Don't second-guess it by offering a discount they didn't ask for.

  Here's the business reality: discounting and creative pricing is one of the most powerful levers you can pull for retention when used strategically. Every coach should have a bottom line number and be willing to go there for the sake of closing a sale that would otherwise be lost.

  Your rev share of a discounted offer is better than your rev share of nothing, and those sales strengthen your numbers for future client assignments. But that doesn't mean you should discount when it's not needed - save that leverage for when it actually matters and will make the difference between a sale and no sale!




---

Step: Purchase
Sub-Step: Closing
Mistake: Keeps Talking After Offering One Option

  Gold Standard: Offer one option, then pause and give space for the client to respond.

  What happened: You filled the silence with more selling, additional explanations, or kept talking instead of pausing after presenting your alternative. This created pressure and confusion, and the decision got delayed.

  Going forward: State the single alternative and stop. Let them answer. Silence is part of the close! When you keep talking after making an offer, you're often talking yourself out of the sale. The client needs a moment to process and decide - don't rob them of that space by filling it with nervous chatter.

  For example:
  Good: "I hear you on budget. Let's do this - I'll offer you the 10-session package at $X per hour. How does that sound?" [PAUSE. WAIT FOR RESPONSE.]

  Bad: "I hear you on budget. Let's do this - I'll offer you the 10-session package at $X per hour, and that really gives you great value because you're getting the work we talked about, plus the text support, and I really think this is going to help you with Jake and the dating stuff we discussed, and you'll have plenty of time to work through everything..." [keeps rambling, client can't get a word in]

  If they hesitate during the pause, acknowledge briefly and present one different option. But give them that initial space to think and respond first.

  Here's the critical business piece: discounting and creative pricing is one of the most powerful levers you can pull for retention. Every coach should have a bottom line number - the lowest they're willing to go - and be willing to discount down to that number for the sake of actually closing the sale. Your rev share percentage of something, even a discounted offer, is better than your percentage of nothing! Even if it's not the biggest win for you hourly, remember: these sales strengthen your overall numbers, which determine your eligibility for new clients to be assigned to you. What you may lose in hourly pay by discounting, you're gaining back in future opportunity.

  Trust the pause. Present your offer confidently, then let silence do its work!

  Gold Standard: Always discuss the Coaching Plan after booking is confirmed - recommend a specific package, explain value clearly, and process payment during the session.

  What happened: You didn't discuss purchase at all - no Coaching Plan recommendation, no pricing conversation, no payment processed. The session ended without any financial commitment or clarity on how they'll continue.

  Going forward: Skipping purchase entirely leaves money on the table and actually does clients a disservice. Here's why this matters:

  For retention: Clients who leave without making a financial commitment are significantly less likely to continue - even if they have an appointment booked. Payment creates investment (literally and psychologically) and increases follow-through dramatically.

  For the client: When you don't discuss the Coaching Plan, you leave them confused about next steps. Do they pay now? Later? How much will this cost? What are they committing to? The ambiguity creates anxiety and obstacles.

  The business reality: You've earned this sale through great coaching. You've shown value, built rapport, created a compelling vision (assuming you did Future Work), and locked in a time (assuming you booked them). Now you need to complete the process by helping them invest in their own growth.

  This isn't "selling" - it's offering continued support toward goals they've shared with you. Frame it that way. After booking, smoothly transition: "Perfect - you're set for Tuesday. Our final step is just to confirm your Coaching Plan." Then recommend the package that fits their needs, explain the value clearly, and process payment.

  Don't leave this undone. A session without purchase discussion is an incomplete NBG that leaves both conversion and clarity on the table. Help them commit fully - they'll thank you for it when they achieve their goals!

Step: General NBG
Sub-Step: Timing
Mistake: Starting NBG Too Late

  Gold Standard: Begin NBG (Future Work) when there are 10-15 minutes remaining in the session, allowing enough time to complete all three components without rushing or going overtime.

  What happened: You started NBG too late in the session - either running overtime or having to rush through Future Work, Booking, and Purchase. This made the process feel hurried and transactional, and may have resulted in incomplete execution of one or more components.

  Going forward: Plan your session time strategically so you can transition into NBG with adequate time remaining. NBG isn't an afterthought or administrative task - it's a critical part of the coaching experience that requires proper time and attention. When you rush through it, the quality suffers: your Future Work pitch feels less thoughtful, booking feels pressured, and purchase feels awkward. Plus, going overtime can make clients feel like you don't respect their time.

  Here's the retention reality: a rushed NBG converts at much lower rates than one that feels natural and unhurried. Build in that 10-15 minute buffer so you can deliver Future Work with warmth and confidence, guide them smoothly through booking, and handle purchase professionally. If you find yourself consistently running late, that's a sign you need to manage session pacing better throughout - not skip or rush NBG at the end.

  Protect that time. Your retention depends on it!


---

Step: General NBG
Sub-Step: Timing
Mistake: Starting NBG Too Early

  Gold Standard: Begin NBG when the coaching content feels complete and there's natural closure to the session discussion - typically with 10-15 minutes remaining.

  What happened: You started NBG too early, before the coaching conversation reached natural completion. This made the transition feel abrupt and may have left the client feeling like you cut them off or didn't fully address their concerns.

  Going forward: Read the room and make sure the coaching content has reached a natural stopping point before transitioning into NBG. While you need to protect time for NBG, you also can't make clients feel rushed out of the actual coaching part of the session. If they're in the middle of processing something important or sharing something vulnerable, let that moment complete before pivoting.

  Here's the balance: you want to leave 10-15 minutes for NBG, but you also want the transition to feel natural and appropriate. If you jump into "So here's what we're going to work on going forward..." while the client is still emotionally processing or mid-thought, it feels jarring and can damage rapport.

  Watch for natural transition cues: the client has shared what they needed to share, the energy is settling, you've provided your key insights, there's a sense of completion to the discussion. That's when you smoothly transition into Future Work. Starting too early can make clients feel unheard or like you're more interested in the pitch than the coaching. Find that sweet spot where the session feels complete and you still have proper time for NBG!


---

Step: General NBG
Sub-Step: Language
Mistake: Tentative Language Throughout NBG

  Gold Standard: Use confident, presumptive language throughout all three components of NBG: "we'll work on," "we're going to," "let's get you booked," "here's what our work together will look like."

  What happened: You used tentative, optional language throughout NBG - phrases like "we can work on" instead of "we'll work on," "if you want to have another session" instead of "when we have our next session," "do you want to book?" instead of "let's get you booked." This undermined your authority and invited hesitation at every step.

  Going forward: Tentative language is one of the biggest conversion killers in NBG. Every time you say "can" instead of "will," or frame something as optional with "if you want to," you're asking the client to question whether they want to continue rather than naturally moving forward with you.

  Examples of weak vs. strong language:
  Tentative (weak):
  - "We can work on your boundaries if you want"
  - "If you'd like to have another session, we could book something"
  - "Do you want to hear about our packages?"
  - "Would you like me to run your card?"

  Presumptive (strong):
  - "We'll work on your boundaries"
  - "Let's get our next session in the books"
  - "Here's what our work together will look like going forward"
  - "Perfect - I'll go ahead and process your Coaching Plan now"

  See the difference? The presumptive language assumes you're moving forward together - which is appropriate because you've just had a great session and built a plan they're excited about. You're not being pushy - you're being a confident guide who believes in the value of the work ahead.

  Check your language throughout all of NBG. "We'll" not "we can." "When" not "if." "Let's" not "do you want to." This shift alone can dramatically improve your conversion rates!

Step: General NBG
Sub-Step: Structure
Mistake: Not Treating NBG as 3 Distinct Steps

  Gold Standard: Execute NBG as three distinct, sequential steps with clear transitions between each: Future Work → pause for buy-in → Booking → lock it in → Purchase. Each step should feel complete before moving to the next.

  What happened: You blurred the components together - wrapping Future Work, Booking, and Purchase into one long monologue without pauses, or jumping from Booking directly to Purchase without getting confirmation. This created confusion, removed natural decision points, and made the whole process feel rushed and overwhelming.

  Going forward: Each component of NBG serves a specific purpose and needs its own space:
  - Future Work creates excitement about the path forward and gets verbal buy-in ("How does that sound?")
  - Booking converts that excitement into concrete commitment with a time on the calendar
  - Purchase completes the commitment with financial investment

  When you blend these together, you lose the power of each step. For example:

  Blurred (doesn't work): "So here's what we're going to work on - boundaries with Jake, communication confidence, and addressing self-blame - and I have Tuesday at 2pm available, the 20-session package is $110/hour which is great savings, so let me get your card and we'll get you all set up."

  Distinct steps (works): "So here's what we're going to work on going forward: [full Future Work with all components]... How does that sound?" [Client confirms] "Great! Let's get our next session in the books. I want to see you early next week so we can start on those boundaries before you see Jake again. Which day works better - Monday or Tuesday?" [Lock in booking] "Perfect - you're set for Tuesday at 2pm. Our final step is just to confirm your Coaching Plan..."

  See the difference? Each step breathes, has its own purpose, and gets its own confirmation before moving forward. This feels natural and guided rather than overwhelming and transactional.

  Treat the three components as distinct phases. Pause between them. Get buy-in before moving forward. This creates momentum while giving the client space to process and commit at each stage!

Step: General NBG
Sub-Step: Timing
Mistake: Going Overtime

  Gold Standard: Complete the entire session including NBG within the scheduled time (typically 45-50 minutes for a session, with 10-15 minutes reserved for NBG).

  What happened: You went over the scheduled session time, either because you started NBG too late or because you weren't managing pacing throughout the session. Going overtime can feel disrespectful of the client's time and may rush the NBG process.

  Going forward: Time management throughout the session is crucial for successful NBG execution. If you consistently find yourself going overtime, you're likely spending too much time on coaching content and not protecting enough time for the pitch.

  Here's what going overtime communicates:
  - You don't respect their schedule
  - You're not in control of the session structure
  - NBG is an afterthought you're trying to squeeze in

  And here's the practical problem: when you go overtime, you're either (1) rushing through NBG which kills conversion, or (2) extending the session which can create resentment or awkwardness.

  Better approach:
  - Monitor time throughout the session
  - Begin wrapping up coaching content with 15 minutes left
  - Transition smoothly into NBG with adequate time
  - Complete all three components (Future Work, Booking, Purchase) within the session window
  - End on time feeling complete and professional

  If you're consistently running over, examine your session pacing: Are you letting tangents take over? Are you over-explaining concepts? Are you not managing client rambling effectively? Fix the pacing issues throughout the session so you can deliver high-quality coaching AND high-quality NBG without going overtime.

  Respecting time boundaries is professional and actually supports retention - it shows you're organized, respectful, and in control of the process!
---

Step: General NBG
Sub-Step: Delivery
Mistake: Rushed/Hurried Delivery

  Gold Standard: Deliver NBG with the same warmth, presence, and care as the rest of the session - not as a checklist to rush through.

  What happened: You treated NBG like a task to get through quickly rather than a meaningful part of the coaching experience. The delivery felt hurried, mechanical, or like you were trying to speed through it to finish the session.

  Going forward: How you deliver NBG matters as much as what you say. When clients sense you're rushing - speaking quickly, glossing over details, moving through the steps without pauses - it feels transactional and can create resistance.

  NBG is not separate from coaching - it's an extension of the care and attention you've shown throughout the session. Your Future Work pitch should feel thoughtful and personalized, not rattled off. Your booking conversation should feel warm and collaborative, not hurried. Your purchase discussion should feel professional and clear, not like you're trying to get it over with.

  Here's the retention reality: a rushed NBG signals "I'm done coaching you, now let me quickly sell you something." A well-paced NBG signals "I'm invested in your success and here's how we're going to continue this important work together."

  Slow down. Breathe. Give each component the time and attention it deserves. Use pauses strategically. Maintain warmth and presence. Treat this as the natural conclusion of a great session, not an administrative burden. When NBG feels like quality coaching time, conversion rates soar!


---

Step: General NBG
Sub-Step: Tone
Mistake: Apologetic Framing

  Gold Standard: Present NBG components confidently and naturally, without apologizing or minimizing their importance.

  What happened: You framed NBG with apologetic language - phrases like "I know this is annoying but we need to book," "Sorry to bring up payment," "I hate to talk about money but..." This undermined the value of continued coaching and made the process feel like an imposition.

  Going forward: Never apologize for NBG! When you apologize or frame it as annoying, you're essentially telling the client that booking another session or investing in coaching is a burden - which directly contradicts the value you've been demonstrating throughout the session.

  Apologetic framing (weak):
  - "I know this is the annoying part, but we should probably book your next session"
  - "Sorry, I have to ask about payment now"
  - "I hate talking about money, but let's discuss the packages"
  - "Real quick, we just need to handle the booking stuff"

  Confident framing (strong):
  - "Let's get our next session in the books"
  - "Our final step is confirming your Coaching Plan"
  - "I'm looking forward to continuing this work with you"

  See the difference? The apologetic framing makes NBG feel like something you're both enduring. The confident framing makes it feel like the natural next step in an exciting journey together.

  If you genuinely believe coaching will help this client (which you should), then there's nothing to apologize for. You're offering them continued support toward their goals - that's valuable, not annoying. Own it with confidence and watch your conversion rates improve!


---

Step: General NBG
Sub-Step: Tone
Mistake: Breaking Character/Energy Shift

  Gold Standard: Maintain the same warm, engaged coaching energy throughout NBG that you had during the session - no shift to "administrator mode."

  What happened: Your energy and tone shifted dramatically when you started NBG. You went from warm, engaged coach to cold, transactional administrator. This jarring shift made NBG feel separate from the coaching and damaged the rapport you'd built.

  Going forward: One of the biggest conversion killers is the energy shift when NBG begins. Clients feel it immediately when you go from "I care about you and your growth" to "Now let me handle the business stuff."

  What the shift looks like:
  - Coaching: warm voice, eye contact, leaning in, engaged
  - NBG: flat voice, looking at screen, distant, mechanical

  What it should look like:
  - Same warm, supportive tone throughout
  - Same level of engagement and presence
  - Same care and attention to their needs
  - NBG feels like a natural extension of the coaching, not a separate transaction

  Think about it: you just spent 35-40 minutes building deep rapport, showing genuine care for their situation, and demonstrating your value as a coach. Don't throw that away by suddenly becoming robotic when it's time to continue the work!

  Your Future Work pitch should feel just as personal and warm as the coaching itself. Your booking conversation should maintain that collaborative energy. Your purchase discussion should still convey "I'm here for you and believe in this work."

  Keep the character. Keep the warmth. Keep the energy. NBG is still coaching - it's just coaching about the path forward. When you maintain consistent energy throughout, clients stay emotionally connected and conversion rates stay high!


---

Step: General NBG
Sub-Step: N/A
Mistake: Skipping NBG Entirely

  Gold Standard: Always complete all three components of NBG (Future Work, Booking, Purchase) at the end of every first session and when appropriate in ongoing sessions.

  What happened: You ended the session without doing NBG at all - no Future Work pitch, no booking attempt, no purchase discussion. The session just... ended.

  Going forward: Skipping NBG entirely is leaving money on the table and abandoning clients who need continued support. This is the biggest missed opportunity possible - you've done great coaching, built rapport, provided value, and then failed to give the client a clear path to continue.

  Why coaches skip NBG:
  - Discomfort with "sales"
  - Running out of time
  - Assuming the client will reach out if interested
  - Forgetting in the moment
  - Conflict avoidance

  Here's the retention reality: Clients almost never proactively book or reach out after a session ends without NBG. They get busy, they forget, they lose momentum, or they assume you're not interested in continuing if you didn't bring it up. Your retention rate without NBG is close to zero.

  What you're actually doing when you skip NBG:
  - Depriving the client of continued support they need
  - Losing revenue you've earned through great coaching
  - Missing the opportunity to help them achieve their goals
  - Making them think you don't believe they need more sessions

  If you fundamentally believe coaching helps people (which you should), then NBG isn't "selling" - it's offering continued support toward goals they've shared with you. It's your responsibility to present that path clearly.

  Do NBG every time. Build it into your session structure. Protect time for it. Make it non-negotiable. Your retention and your clients' success both depend on it!


---

Step: General NBG
Sub-Step: Sequence
Mistake: Doing Steps Out of Order

  Gold Standard: Always follow the correct sequence: Future Work → Booking → Purchase. Never skip ahead or rearrange these steps.

  What happened: You executed the NBG components out of order - such as discussing purchase before booking, or trying to book before completing Future Work. This broke the natural flow and reduced conversion.

  Going forward: The sequence matters because each step builds on the previous one:
  - Future Work creates excitement and shows value → gets buy-in
  - Booking converts excitement into concrete commitment → anchors a time
  - Purchase completes the commitment → seals the deal

  When you do them out of order, you lose the psychological momentum:

  Wrong: Purchase before Booking - If you ask for payment before they have an appointment on the calendar, you're asking for financial commitment without practical commitment. They might pay but never schedule, or the lack of a concrete appointment makes payment feel scarier. Plus, you lose the leverage that booking gives you for negotiating price concerns.

  Wrong: Booking before Future Work - If you try to book before pitching Future Work, clients don't understand WHY they should book. They haven't heard the compelling vision of what you'll accomplish together. You're asking them to commit to something undefined.

  Wrong: Jumping around - Going back and forth between components ("let me explain the work... actually let's book first... wait, let me tell you about pricing...") creates confusion and kills momentum.

  Right sequence every time:
  1. Complete Future Work fully (Opening → Game Plan → Camaraderie Close → buy-in)
  2. Transition to Booking and lock in a time
  3. Transition to Purchase and close the sale

  Follow the order. Trust the process. Each step is designed to lead naturally to the next. Breaking the sequence breaks the conversion!


---

Step: General NBG
Sub-Step: Client Management
Mistake: Getting Derailed by Client

  Gold Standard: Gently but firmly maintain the NBG flow even when clients try to steer back into coaching content. Hold the boundary while staying warm and supportive.

  What happened: When you started NBG, the client brought up new coaching content or pulled the conversation back into problem-solving, and you followed them instead of redirecting back to NBG. This derailed the booking process and may have resulted in ending without completing NBG.

  Going forward: Clients will often try to continue coaching when you transition into NBG - not because they're trying to avoid booking, but because they're engaged and want to keep processing. Your job is to honor their engagement while also protecting the NBG flow.

  What derailing looks like:
  - You start Future Work, client says "Wait, I just thought of something about what we discussed..."
  - You're in the middle of booking, client asks "Can I ask you one more question about Jake?"
  - You're presenting the Coaching Plan, client launches into a new concern

  How to redirect warmly:
  - "I love that you're thinking about this - and that's exactly the kind of thing we'll dive into in our next session. Let me just get us booked so we have time set aside to explore that fully. [Continue with booking]"
  - "That's a great question, and I want to give it the attention it deserves rather than rushing through it now. Let's lock in our next time first, and we'll tackle that right away when we meet. [Continue with booking]"
  - "I'm so glad that came up - I'm writing that down so we make sure to address it next time. First, let's get you scheduled so we have dedicated space for that conversation. [Continue with booking]"

  The key: Acknowledge, validate, promise to address it, redirect back to NBG. Don't ignore them, but don't get pulled off track either.

  Here's the retention reality: if you get derailed and never complete NBG, they likely won't book. You need to gently hold the boundary while maintaining warmth. This is good coaching AND good business - you're teaching them that sessions have structure, time boundaries matter, and you'll address their concerns properly in the next session rather than rushing through them at the end!


---

Step: General NBG
Sub-Step: Delivery
Mistake: Over-explaining/Rambling

  Gold Standard: Keep NBG clear, concise, and purposeful. Say what needs to be said, then pause. Don't fill every silence with unnecessary talking.

  What happened: You over-explained throughout NBG - giving too much information, too many options, or filling every pause with additional talking. This created confusion, overwhelm, and reduced conversion.

  Going forward: More words doesn't equal better results. In fact, over-explaining is one of the fastest ways to talk yourself out of a sale. Here's what happens when you ramble:
  - You create decision fatigue by providing too many options
  - You undermine your own confidence by over-justifying
  - You fill important silence that clients need to process and decide
  - You introduce doubts or objections they hadn't thought of yet
  - You make simple things sound complicated

  What over-explaining looks like:

  Future Work rambling: "So we'll work on boundaries, and I mean really understanding what boundaries are and how to communicate them effectively, and it's not just about saying no but about knowing what you need and being able to express that clearly without guilt, and we'll also look at why boundaries have been hard for you historically and what patterns might be underneath that..." [Client glazes over, loses the thread]

  Booking rambling: "Let's get you scheduled, I mean if you want to, and we can look at next week, or maybe the week after if that's better, and I have mornings and afternoons, though some days are more open than others, and we can always move it if your schedule changes, so there's no pressure..." [Creates hesitation through tentative over-explaining]

  Purchase rambling: "The 20-session package is great because it gives you time, and I think time is really important, not that you couldn't make progress with fewer sessions, but having more sessions means we don't have to rush, and you'll also save money per session, which is nice, and there's installments available, though you don't have to use those if you don't want to..." [Confuses value proposition, undermines confidence]

  What concise delivery looks like:

  Future Work concise: "We'll work on three things: establishing clear boundaries with Jake, rebuilding your communication confidence, and addressing that self-blame pattern. How does that sound?" [Clear, memorable, purposeful]

  Booking concise: "Let's get you in early next week so we can work on that message to him while everything's fresh. Which day works better - Tuesday or Wednesday?" [Direct, purposeful, moves forward]

  Purchase concise: "Based on the work we outlined, I recommend the 20-session package. Sessions are $120/hour compared to $180 single sessions. This package also includes installments if you'd prefer to split the payments. How does that sound?" [Clear value, simple decision]

  Remember these principles:
  - Say what needs to be said, then stop
  - Trust the pause - silence is okay
  - Don't fill gaps with nervous talking
  - One clear point > three confusing points
  - Less is often more in conversion conversations

  Be clear, be concise, be confident. Then pause and let your words land!


---

Step: General NBG
Sub-Step: Client Management
Mistake: Not Adapting to Resistance

  Gold Standard: Stay flexible and responsive when clients show hesitation. Adjust your approach based on their specific concerns rather than rigidly following a script.

  What happened: When the client expressed resistance or hesitation, you either ignored it and pushed forward with your script, or you gave up entirely. You didn't adapt your approach to address their specific concern.

  Going forward: NBG requires both structure AND flexibility. While you need to follow the three-step sequence, you also need to read the client and adapt when resistance appears.

  What resistance looks like:
  - Price concerns
  - Scheduling uncertainty
  - Hesitation about commitment
  - Questions about value
  - General reluctance

  Bad response #1 - Ignoring resistance: Client: "That's more than I expected to spend." Coach: [Continues with script] "Great, so I'll go ahead and process your card now." [Client feels unheard, resistance hardens]

  Bad response #2 - Giving up: Client: "That's more than I expected to spend." Coach: "Oh, okay. Well, think about it and let me know." [Lost sale, client likely never books]

  Good response - Adapting: Client: "That's more than I expected to spend." Coach: "I hear you on budget - that makes total sense. Let's find a way to make this work. I can offer you the 10-session package at a discounted rate, which brings it down to $X per session. How does that sound?" [Addresses concern, offers solution, keeps momentum]

  The key to adapting:
  - Acknowledge the concern (don't ignore or minimize it)
  - Understand the real issue (is it total price? timing? commitment level?)
  - Offer one specific solution that addresses their concern
  - Maintain forward momentum while being responsive

  Examples of adaptation:
  - Timing concern: "I'm not sure about my schedule next week" → Offer placeholder: "Let's pencil something in now and you can always adjust it"
  - Commitment concern: "I don't know if I need 20 sessions" → Adjust package: "Let's start with 10 sessions and see how it goes"
  - Value concern: "I'm not sure this will help" → Reinforce Future Work: "Remember, we're specifically working on [their urgent goals]"
  - Budget concern: "I can't afford this right now" → Offer alternatives: "I can do session-by-session at the package rate so there's no big upfront cost"

  Stay responsive, stay flexible, stay solution-oriented. The structure guides you, but adaptation closes the sale!

Step: General NBG
Sub-Step: Framing
Mistake: Treating NBG as Separate from Session

  Gold Standard: NBG is a seamless part of the coaching experience, not a separate "logistics" phase. It should feel like a natural continuation of the care and support you've provided.

  What happened: You framed or treated NBG as separate from the actual coaching - saying things like "Okay, now we're done with the real session, let's handle logistics" or shifting your entire demeanor to indicate "coaching time is over, business time begins."

  Going forward: This framing is one of the most damaging things you can do to conversion. When you treat NBG as separate, you're essentially telling the client:
  - The valuable part is over
  - This next part is just administrative
  - The coaching has ended and now we're doing something different
  - This is the "business" part you have to endure

  What separating sounds like:
  - "Okay, we're done with coaching - now let's talk logistics"
  - "The hard part is over, now we just need to handle booking"
  - "So that's the session - let me just quickly run through the packages"
  - "Now for the not-fun part..." [laughs nervously]

  What integration looks like:
  NBG is framed as caring for the client's continued growth, not as separate logistics:
  - Future Work: This is you as a coach outlining the thoughtful, personalized plan for their continued growth. It's an extension of your coaching wisdom.
  - Booking: This is you ensuring they have protected time and space to continue the important work you've started together. It's caring for their commitment.
  - Purchase: This is you helping them invest in their own growth and success. It's supporting their goals.

  The language shift:
  - Separate (weak): "Okay, coaching's done! Now let's handle the business stuff."
  - Integrated (strong): "So here's what our work together will look like going forward..." [Seamless transition]
  - Separate (weak): "Real quick, we just need to get you booked and handle payment."
  - Integrated (strong): "Let's make sure you have time on the calendar to continue this important work. I want to get you in next week so we can..." [Purpose-driven, connected to their goals]

  Here's the mindset shift: NBG isn't something separate you do TO clients - it's something you do FOR clients. You're extending care, offering continued support, and helping them commit to their own growth. When you see it that way and communicate it that way, clients feel it.

  The entire session - from opening small talk to final payment - is one cohesive experience of support and growth. Keep it integrated, keep it seamless, keep it focused on their success!
